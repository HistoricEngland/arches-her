    <h2>Accessibility statement for Keystone</h2>
    <p>This accessibility statement applies to keystone.historicengland.org.uk in its entirety. </p>
    <p>This website is run by Historic England and <em>is currently only available on the corporate network</em>. We
        want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you should be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
        <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
        <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
        <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and
            VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand, though there are technical terms related to
        the subject matter.</p>
    <p><a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you
        have a disability.</p>
    <h3>How accessible is this website?</h3>
    <p>Some key aspects that are not fully accessible are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li> the relationship graphs are provided in a visual format that is not interpretable by a screen reader</li>
        <li>maps are primarily provided as raster image tiles, which means that a screen reader cannot interpret the
            contents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This website is built using the Arches open source software platform, jointly developed by the Getty Conservation
        Institute and World Monuments Fund. This website is built using version 6.1.0 of Arches. Accessibility work is
        undertaken on this platform and is a continuing process, of which a key participant is Historic England.</p>
    <p>More information on Arches is available: <a href="http://www.archesproject.org">www.archesproject.org</a>
    </p>

        (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
    <h3>Compliance status</h3>
    <p>This website is partially compliant with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility
            Guidelines version 2.1</a> AA standard, due to ‘the non-compliances and exemptions’ listed below.</p>
    <h2>Non-accessible content</h2>
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons:</p>
    <h3>Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations </h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 1.3.1</strong> - Info and Relationships: Information, structure, and relationships
            conveyed through presentation can be programmatically determined or are available in text. </li>
        <ul>
            <li> We are aware of various form labels that aren’t associated with appropriate form fields and that
                fieldsets should be used </li>
            <li>Pages affected: Search, Create new resource, Resource editor, Resource report, Resource history, Related
                resources, Recent edits and Exporter</li>
            <li>Required fields should be displayed as “required” or display an asterix, pages include Profile manager
                and Change password form – validation also missing</li>
            <li>Incorrect heading ordering, should be like h1, h2, h3, h3, h3 etc. Pages affected: Resource editor and
                Resource history</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 1.3.2</strong> - Meaningful Sequence: When the sequence in which content is
            presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Tabbing with a keyboard should follow a sequential, expected order. Pages affected: Map layer manager
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 1.4.3</strong> - Contrast (Minimum):The visual presentation of text and images of
            text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1, except for the following:</li>
        <ul>
            <li> Large Text: Large-scale text and images of large-scale text have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1;</li>
            <li>Incidental: Text or images of text that are part of an inactive user interface component, that are pure
                decoration, that are not visible to anyone, or that are part of a picture that contains significant
                other visual content, have no contrast requirement.</li>
            <li>Logotypes: Text that is part of a logo or brand name has no contrast requirement. </li>
            <li>Pages affected: Time filter section, Recent edits and Reference data manager – a lot of work has already
                been done regarding this checkpoint on all the other pages</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 1.4.4</strong> - Resize text: Except for captions and images of text, text can be
            resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 1.4.10</strong> - Reflow: Content can be presented without loss of information or
            functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for: </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;</li>
            <li>Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels;</li>
            <p>Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning. </p>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 1.4.11</strong> - Non-text Contrast: The visual presentation of the following has a
            contrast ratio of at least 3:1 against adjacent colour(s):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>User Interface Components</li>
            <li>Visual information required to identify user interface components and states, except for inactive
                components or where the appearance of the component is determined by the user agent and not modified by
                the author;</li>
            <li>Graphical Objects</li>
            <li>Parts of graphics required to understand the content, except when a particular presentation of graphics
                is essential to the information being conveyed.</li>
            <li>Affected pages: Homepage (social media icons) and Search (all buttons)</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 1.4.13</strong> - Content on Hover or Focus: Where receiving and then removing
            pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following
            are true:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Dismissable: A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or
                keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace
                other content;</li>
            <li>Hoverable: If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the
                additional content without the additional content disappearing; </li>
            <li>Persistent: The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user
                dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.</li>
            <li>Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not
                modified by the author.</li>
            <li>Affected pages: Popups/modals, although some work has been done, we need to check all pages and
                functionality</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 2.1.1</strong> - Keyboard: All functionality of the content is operable through a
            keyboard interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying
            function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Using a keyboard, all content should be able to be tabbed through, lists should be expandable and
                collapsible. Pages affected: Arches designer, Create new resource (list of models), Resource editor,
                Resource report, Resource History, Related resources, Map layer manager, Arches collector manager and
                Map legend filters</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 2.1.2</strong> - No Keyboard Trap: If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of
            the page using a keyboard interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a keyboard
            interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys or other standard exit methods, the
            user is advised of the method for moving focus away.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard focus can be moved away from the content. Pages affected: Systems settings, Resource manager,
                Arches designer, Map layer manager, Arches collector manager, Profile manager, Reference data manager
            </li>
            <li>There are no links present to navigate a user back to the Keystone landing page </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 2.4.2</strong> - Page Titled: Web pages have titles that describe topic or purpose.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Page title needs to update to a state purpose. Affected page: Create new resource </li>
            <li>Landing page / homepage title needs to be more descriptive</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 2.4.3</strong> - Focus Order: If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the
            navigation sequences affect meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that
            preserves meaning and operability.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Keyboard focus should follow a logical order. Pages affected: Create new resource, Arches designer. All
                other pages need further checking.</li>
            <li>Popup dialogs should be given immediate focus once opened. Pages affected: Search filter popups, Alerts,
                Help, Delete resource, Arches collector manager (Map extent)</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 2.4.4</strong> - Link Purpose (In Context): The purpose of each link can be
            determined from the link text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link
            context, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Links must be clear and help users to understand its purpose. Affected pages: Landing/Homepage, Search,
                Resource manager, left side navigation, Arches collector manager, icon link on the top navigation</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 2.4.7</strong> - Focus Visible: Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of
            operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>When opening an Advanced search card, currently it is not obvious what element currently has keyboard
                focus </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 2.5.1</strong> - Pointer Gestures: All functionality that uses multipoint or
            path-based gestures for operation can be operated with a single pointer without a path-based gesture, unless
            a multipoint or path-based gesture is essential.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>All pages need to be checked so that the mouse  wheel can be used to scroll up and down content. When
                using this on a map, the map should zoon in and out accordingly</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 2.5.3</strong> - Label in Name: For user interface components with labels that
            include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>All pages need to be checked to ensure screen readers can properly read out all labels and titles </li>
            <li>All icons need to be checked and should have an accessible name</li>
            <li>Href titles in navigation should match page headings</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 3.2.3</strong> - Consistent Navigation: Navigational mechanisms that are repeated on
            multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages occur in the same relative order each time they are repeated,
            unless a change is initiated by the user. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>Affected pages: Search, Resource manager, Arches designer, Recent edits, Profile manager and Reference
                data manager</li>
            <li>Need to check “skip to content” links are working on all pages</li>
            <li>On the landing page, there is a link that is displayed “Welcome user”, when clicked it opens the Profile
                manager page, so the link should correspond by reading “Profile manager”</li>
            <li>On the landing page there is a link that is displayed “Manage”, when clicked it opens the Resource
                manager page, so the link should correspond by reading “Resource manager” </li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 3.2.4</strong> - Consistent Identification: Components that have the same
            functionality within a set of Web pages are identified consistently.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pages affected: Resource manager and Profile manager</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 3.3.1</strong> - Error Identification: If an input error is automatically detected,
            the item that is in error is identified and the error is described to the user in text.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Where form validation is required, check that there is a validation error summary at the top of the form
            </li>
            <li>Change password form currently has no validation error message present</li>
            <li>Error suggestion message on the Edit profile page is not detailed enough</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 3.3.2</strong> - Labels or Instructions: Labels or instructions are provided when
            content requires user input.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Placeholder text is not read out using a screen reader so need to ensure to add relevant aria-label’s or
                add proper form labels. Affected pages: User confirm signup, Reference data manager, Arches designer
                (branch list and branch editing), Create new resource, Resource editor, Resource report, Resource
                history, Related resource, Map layer manager, Collector project manager, Collector designer, Recent
                edits, Exporter</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 3.3.3</strong> - Error Suggestion: If an input error is automatically detected and
            suggestions for correction are known, then the suggestions are provided to the user, unless it would
            jeopardize the security or purpose of the content.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Pages Affected: Validation messages on the Profile manager page</li>
            <li>Also need to identify other pages that have validation messages</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 3.3.4</strong> - Error Prevention: For Web pages that cause legal commitments or
            financial transactions for the user to occur, that modify or delete user-controllable data in data storage
            systems, or that submit user test responses, at least one of the following is true:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Reversible: Submissions are reversible.</li>
            <li>Checked: Data entered by the user is checked for input errors and the user is provided an opportunity to
                correct them.</li>
            <li>Confirmed: A mechanism is available for reviewing, confirming, and correcting information before
                finalizing the submission.</li>
            <li>When deleting a resource, there should be a checkbox to confirm deletion</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 4.1.1</strong> – Parsing: In content implemented using markup languages, elements
            have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not
            contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>All pages need to be checked, copy and paste rendered html into the W3C Markup Validator (<a
                    href="https://validator.w3.org/">https://validator.w3.org/</a>). We are aware that there are missing
                end tags, non unique id values, empty class and style tags</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 4.1.2</strong> - Name, Role, Value: For all user interface components (including but
            not limited to: form elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be
            programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be
            programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user agents, including
            assistive technologies.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>All pages need to be checked but we have already identified a few issues:</li>
            <li>Use aria-controls and aria-expanded to define what something controls (tabs&gt;panels) and its state
            </li>
            <li>Add to search map toggle should be checkbox not SPAN</li>
            <li>Find elements on new resource and graph designer needs aria-pressed to show the button is toggled</li>
            <li>Ensure various tree lists, have things like aria-expanded, aria-pressed, aria-multiselectable,
                aria-selected, aria-hidden ...to easily identify the current state of the tree </li>
            <li>As mentioned below certain third party plugins are used for tree views and feature rich drop-downs and
                fields. These source code of third party plugins cannot be changed by us</li>
            <li>On an iPhone (xs iOS 13.4.1 – Safari 13) the voiceover does not read out the world or layer icons when
                pressed </li>
            <li>On an iPhone (xs iOS 13.4.1 – Safari 13) voiceover fails to read out the column sorted button on the
                Recent edits page</li>
        </ul>
        <li><strong>WCAG Checkpoint 4.1.3</strong> - Status Messages: In content implemented using markup languages,
            status messages can be programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be
            presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus. </li>
        <ul>
            <li>We are aware that status messages for deleting a record, change password form and edit account pages,
                either remain open or are displaying even when an incorrect entry has been made </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h3>Disproportionate burden</h3>
    <p>Applying accessibility features to the Django administration section. This will only be used by system
        administrators to set user permissions. Django is a major open source project used across the web and applying
        changes here would be hard due to the need to get considerable agreement from external parties prior to carrying
        out any work that would in turn be developed in Django, as well as significant investment financially. Further
        information available in <a href="https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/31617">Django Project #31617: Improve
            overall admin accessibility</a>.</p>
    <p>Components where maps are used to draw and filter data are incredibly complex, and there is no agreed solution in
        the web maps community in terms of accessibility for map editing tools, map search tools, nor map display. This
        would create large amounts of speculative work and may result in significant maintenance costs that may be
        disregarded by others and requires the agreement and standards ratification of external bodies to be effective.
        This includes the format of maps used, which are formed of raster images that are unable to be interpreted by
        screen readers.</p>
    <p>The display of relationship graphs between different resources within Keystone uses a library called <a
            href="https://cytoscape.org">cytoscape.js</a> to draw the shapes (circular points consisting of each
        resource) and connecting lines (relationships). These interactive graphs are not accessible to screen readers,
        however, there is an alternative format to view this information that exists in the associated resource’s
        report, which is linked to from a box on the page, as well as the search results list. </p>
    <p>The “Time wheel” user interface component uses a library called d3.js for generating a sunburst chart to depict
        the distribution of data by date. This is an open source library that we are not able to apply fixes to and this
        also applies to other third-party plugins that aren't fully accessible in Keystone. </p>
    <p>Throughout the site, there are many occurrences where third party plugins called Chosen and Select2 are used.
        These plugins enrich form fields to provide multiple selections and searchable list dropdowns. Unfortunately,
        both these plugins fall short on accessibility with regards to keyboard use, tabbing and the ability to add
        labels for screen readers.</p>
    <p>Here is a list of non-accessible form fields we have identified that we believe are disproportionate: </p>
    <p><a href="https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen"><strong>Chosen</strong></a>:<br> (also note this plugin has been
        marked as deprecated in their GitHub repository)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unable to tab through 'type' and 'within' fields in Time Filter on the Map<br> (cannot implement tab
            navigation)</li>
        <li>Resource history page is not operable using the keyboard<br> (Cannot make the dropdown operable by keyboard,
            however we have made the information navigable with the keyboard and have also introduced a back to top
            button for returning to the top of the page) </li>
    </ul>
    <p><a href="https://select2.org/"><strong>Select2</strong></a>:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No aria label present for the search bar on the search page<br> (cannot add an aria-label for screen
            readers) </li>
        <li>The search box on the Reference Data Manager page does not have an aria label<br> (cannot add an aria-label
            for screen readers)</li>
        <li>Search label is missing for the search bar<br> (cannot add an aria-label or aria-labelledby for screen
            readers) </li>
        <li>Aria labels are not present on all pagination buttons hence screen reader would not read out page numbers in
            a meaningful way.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>On the Search page, a panel displays when the Filter button is clicked which includes a link to allow the user to
        edit the GeoJSON data. A third-party editor called <a href="https://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a> is being
        used here and this is not accessible with regards to having initial focus and being able to tab out of the code
        box if it does have focus, as this is interpreted as a tab or indent command within the editor. We consider it
        counter-intuitive to make the editor work differently, as it would be both expensive to implement and maintain,
        and also unsupported by the developers.</p>
    <p>The Reference Data Manager page includes a collapsible tree view, this uses a third party plugin called <a
            href="https://mbraak.github.io/jqTree/">jqTree</a> which is not directly accessible via keyboard navigation.
        Once the tree has focus, the keyboard can be used to navigate the tree values, but this relies on a manual mouse
        click to give the tree initial focus.</p>
    <p>In the resource editor, when a user goes in to view the history of the resource, the page is not operable using
        the keyboard however this shouldn’t matter as there is no content to view on the page. </p>
    <p>We have assessed the implications and cost of resolving the above issues, along with willingness of collaboration
        and agreement from stakeholders in territories not covered by these regulations. We believe that doing so now
        would be a <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2018/952/regulation/7/made">disproportionate burden</a>
        within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will monitor and reassess as any updates are released
        for the third-party tools.</p>
    <h3>Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
    <p>Maps are exempt from the accessibility regulations where they are not providing an essential public service, but
        alternative information is provided in the search results, and the coordinate data relating to specific
        resources recorded in Keystone is provided within the resource reports in a technical format that can be
        translated into other forms.</p>
    <h2>What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    <p>The Arches project provides the underlying platform for the Keystone website, and we are actively collaborating
        with other organisations on the development of the platform. It is a worldwide project, so there is development
        input from parties that are not subject to the accessibility regulations, but we are advocating for increased
        knowledge and empathy for users with various accessibility needs, actively carrying out work to make our own
        website accessible, as well as contributing fixes and guidance for the project as a whole, for the benefit of
        others.</p>

    <h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
    <p>This statement was prepared on xx March 2022. It was last reviewed on xx March 2022.</p>
    <p>This website is being continuously tested for accessibility concerns. This testing has been carried out by Ten10
        on behalf of Historic England, embedded in our development team.</p>
    <p>We evaluate every functional template within the Keystone website we identify. This includes access for
        non-logged in and logged-in users, as well as editing interfaces and administrative areas.</p>
