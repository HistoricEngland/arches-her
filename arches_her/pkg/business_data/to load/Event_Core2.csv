The first comprised part of a building of possible 12th-13th Century date with an associated yard surface of rammed gravel; a much repaired mortar floor may also relate to this phase. The second phase was represented by a chalk cellar or undercroft, possibly of the 15th Century, inserted within the walls of the earlier building and including part of a window or chute and a recess.

A wooden corduroy track beneath the road make-up was either an earlier road, perhaps of military character, or a foundation for the road base. Occupation layers were uncovered on either side of the road, including evidence of a timber building on the northeast side and a wood-lined latrine, probably of 2nd Century date.

Once it was confirmed that archaeological material did survive beneath the slab three testpits were excavated to determine the character and significance of these deposits. Two of the testpits were positioned in order to confirm the location and extent of survival of the southern wall of the Roman fort.  The level of the 'natural' brickearth across the site was recorded at a maximum height of 12.30m OD. No in-situ archaeological remains associated with the Cripplegate fort survived in the testpits, although deposits of Roman date were present within the area of the fort and in land which would have been to the south of the fort. A Roman pit or ditch was recorded and residual Roman pottery was recovered from Medieval and modern pits.  Medieval pits and truncated chalk and flint wall foundations were also recorded. Early Medieval pottery was recovered from a modern intrusion.  The archaeological deposits were severely truncated by modern and Victorian foundations and modern services. A ground beam observed in the section of testpit 3 may indicate that the foundations of the existing building are more substantial than originally thought.

The presence of deep Victorian basements on the site resulted in the truncation of all horizontal archaeological deposits. The redeposited brickearth slab seen elsewhere in the area of the Cripplegate Fort did not survive the truncation of the cellars on the site. The level of modern truncation had removed all evidence for the Roman fort. Several undated brickearth-filled pits may be Roman but no pits have been dated to the Roman period. Roman pottery was residual in Medieval features and consisted mainly of pottery dating after AD 250.  Medieval features consisted mainly of back filled pits, probably cesspits as very little domestic waste was recovered from the fills. The earliest feature dated, 970-1100, was a narrow but deep sub-rectangular cut with a 'u' -shaped base. The shape ofthe cut and the presence of fragments of Kentish rag stone in the fills suggests that it may have been a robbed foundation cut, although not very long in length (1.8m). However, similar features have been recorded to the west of the site at WOO97 (ELO9450 and 4926) where they have been interpreted as pits associated with the construction of deep wells and were of a contemporary date.  Two other features have been dated to this Early Medieval period (1080-1150), one of which was located in the eastern part of the trench. It Was almost completely truncated by modern disturbance in that only 0.57m depth survived. The depth of this pit suggested it was dug for the extraction of the natural sands and gravels and baclfilled with domestic waste and probably cess. The second Early Medieval feature was again very truncated with only 0.45m of fill surviving with the cut almost completely removed. However, the fills were of interest, the uppermost fill was reminiscent of an occupation deposit and was up to 180mm thick. This overlay a deposit of burnt brickearth and charcoal up to 120mm thick. This in turn sealed a dark grey charcoal and silt deposit. The base of the' cut' also contained two small stakeholes. The material within the fill and the presence of the stakeholes suggests that this was a structural cut. The uppermost deposit was at 11.89m OD and the base of the cut at 11.48m OD. If a structural cut it may represent the very truncated remnant of a sunken building. Similar slumped occupation deposits of contemporary date were recorded to the west of the site at W0097 (Ibid).  Two pits dated to 1180-1200 and 1230-1400 were recorded. These may have been cesspits. Very few finds were recovered from these pits which were located in the western.end of the trench.  Two Post Medieval pits were also recorded. It is not clear what their function was but they were likely to have been for the disposal of rubbish.  *The naturally deposited brickearth only survived along the Love Lane frontage and was recorded at 11. 79m OD to the west of the site and l1.31m OD to the east.

Four areas were investigated, three along the Aldersgate frontage and one in the angle between Aldersgate and Little Britain. Extensive truncation by modern buildings meant that in some areas only intrusive features dug into natural brickearth survived; these included three Medieval wells, one of which was barrel lined.  Effort was concentrated on the northernmost trench where horizontal stratigraphy survived to a depth of up to 1m. Here two well-built chalk foundations were found. One of these formed the side of a cellar, the backfill of which contained a Medieval glass urinal. Another prominent feature of this trench were the wattle and plank lined pits which produced textile fragments and a quantity of leatherwork, including one nearly complete shoe with decorative silk stitching down the central vamp. All or some of this north area may have been within the precinct of St Bartholomew's Priory.

The area of foreshore was surveyed between the steps east of the Founders Arms public house to the steps adjacent to the Globe Theatre, approximately 270m in length. In a previous survey (Sloane 1998) the earliest deposit, found stretching westward as far as the western end of Bankside Power Station pontoon, was a gravel layer. It was clearly preNeolithic in date, and was probably deposited by the river towards the end of the last Ice Age. Sealing this deposit to a depth of over 0.5m in places was a horizon of fine blue silty clays. Near the low water mark, they have been revealed in patches and found to incorporate the remains of small in situ alder tree bases and roots. These remains indicate that the level of the Thames 5000 years ago was below the level where they grew (at approximately -I.9m OD). It is therefore probable that Neolithic land surfaces survive under much of the modern foreshore. The upper sediments have suffered significant anthropogenic disturbance probably during Post Medieval times. Archaeological deposits including timber structures and indirect evidence for transport of goods in the Post Medieval period was discovered on the foreshore. Most of the foreshore itself appears to be man-made, with compacted layers forming deliberate consolidation. These included bargebeds, rubble infilling behind timber wharves, nail scatters, drains and other features. The presence of the compacted bargebeds does strongly suggest that earlier deposits right the way down to possible Bronze Age peat deposits (as located at Anchor Terrace at -0.3m OD) may survive in the vicinity of the river wall. Examination of the material surrounding the pontoon during its removal did not reveal any of the peat deposits. The area has now been covered by a scour protection mat of stone.",A polygon covering the approximate area of the site was drawn at a scale of 1:1000 using OS MasterMap data as a base.

The W5 Block was built in 1921 to the design of T S Darbyshire although the Regent Street elevations were designed in 1909 by Frank Verity. It is normally assumed that a listed building contributes towards the areas character although in this case it can be said that the parts of Triumph House behind the Regent Street elevation share none of its characteristics and detract from it.

In the late 1st-early 2nd Century AD buildings divided by alleys were constructed over the whole site; the south building fronted off the site to the south. They were also destroyed by fire (probably Hadrianic). These buildings included opus signinum and tessellated floors. A further period of less substantial building (125-60) reproduced the previous boundaries on a smaller scale; this period was also ended by a fire.

The foundations were of gravel below undressed stone rubble, in rough courses, above which up to 1m of neat masonry superstructure survived. The core of the bastion, which was not dismantled, contained a coping stone and another partially moulded stone. Above this lay a series of dumps of 1650-1800, through which was cut a brick-lined cesspit abutting both wall and bastion and containing material provisionally dated to the same period. In a large testpit in the adjacent car park to the N, the wall survived intact to a height of 3m above foundations.  Following these preliminary excavations underneath the railway viaduct, a series of excavations took place between October 1987 and January 1988, also funded by Central and City Properties Ltd. Of 39 trenches sited where pile-caps were to be inserted to support a new building above the railway, 20 were excavated archaeologically and the rest by contractors.  The Roman city wall ran north/south across the site and, to the north, a 32m length was exposed (to be consolidated and displayed in the future building); it survived up to 2m high above original ground level on the east side. A change in build was evident on the inner face. North of this change a tile drain ran through the wall. A gravel metalled surface on the berm survived intact 0.6m below the sandstone plinth on the wall face, and the V-profile of the base of the original ditch was recorded.  In the west a hard gravel surface, dated to the late 2nd/early 3rd Century, and probably a construction road for the wall, was sealed by dumps of sand, gravel and brickearth originally banked up against the inside of the wall, containing 2nd Century pottery.  Very thick deposits of dark earth or similar strata extended west, cut by pits, wells and lines of stake-holes, probably fencing. Datable finds suggest that occupation was continuous from the 11th Century. A large pitched stone Medieval culvert was inserted through the wall and remained in use until the 19th Century. To the east, a Medieval or later ditch cut sloped down further east than the recorded Roman ditch. It was backfilled and the area levelled up with dumps of homogeneous gravel containing 17th Century pottery, cut in turn by Post Medieval horncore-lined pits. No evidence was found of substantial buildings before the 17th Century, and parts of the site remained open until the construction of the railway viaduct in the 1840s, when much of the city wall was also demolished.  Roman finds included a bow brooch and quantities of glass from bottles, flasks and a pillar-moulded bowl; bone counters and fragments of two slate bracelets. Late Medieval lead tokens and two cloth seals came from metal-detecting. There was also a range of Post Medieval glassware, including wine glasses, phials and a near-complete beaker with chequered spiral decoration. Other Post Medieval finds included an ivory comb and several knives.",

The earliest Roman activity at Guildhall Yard was for brickearth quarries and scatted pits and ditches and was dated to the mid-1st Century AD.  After AD70 the site was stripped of topsoil and a timber Amphitheatre constructed.  Dendrochronological evidence from timbers used in the eastern entrance to the arena indicate a construction date of AD74.  This amphitheatre occupied an apparently peripheral location in the north-western part of the early Roman town and underwent a number of repairs and alterations in its initial phase before a significant remodelling after AD90.  The amphitheatre was dismantled and rebuilt, partly in stone, in the 2nd Century.  The design of the eastern entranceway included two small side chambers adjacent to the arena, presumably for the penning of animals.  Knowledge of the rest of the structure is more fragmentary beyond small parts of its outer wall line and possible southern and northern entranceways.  The amphitheatre remained in use until the 4th Century AD, and was the latest substantial building in use in the western part of the city by the mid-4th Century.    Evidence for the abandonment, decay and robbing of the amphitheatre was sealed by the development of mid-Late Saxon timber and wattle buildings with associated yards, of 10th Century date. These buildings were cleared in the early 12th Century for the development of the Guildhall and Guildhall Yard.  In a corner of the excavated area was a churchyard with 50 or more burials.  This was interpreted as representing the earliest phase of St Lawrence Jewry.  Along the south side of the site, under Guildhall Buildings was recorded the remains of Blackwell Hall, first built c 1275 and the main cloth market in London for Centuries from c 1395.  Evidence of foundations of the initial phase of this building, in addition to substantial modifications, was recorded.  In the north-west corner of the site more Medieval masonry was recorded under the existing Guildhall porch, of potentially 12th Century date.  This would indicate the earliest evidence for the emergence of the Guildhall area as the centre of administration in the Medieval city.  *Natural gravels were recorded at heights of 10.22m OD in the west of the site and 10.28m OD in the east*",

Excavations were carried out in the north and at the south end of the site. The earliest indication of activity occurred in the north area where the natural gravels were cut by a drainage ditch of early 2nd Century date, and by the construction of the Roman defensive wall (which is dated elsewhere to the late 2nd-early 3rd Century). On this site the wall had become incorporated into a property boundary, its outer face forming part of the western boundary of the site. A total length of about 22.5m was recorded, with a 10m stretch surviving 3m in height up to the third tile course and with numerous post-Roman repairs. Some 3m in advance of the wall the contemporary V-shaped ditch was recorded in both the north and south areas of the site: it was about 2m deep and about 4m wide. The remains of Bastion 4 were located in the S and a hitherto unknown bastion, to be called B4A, was discovered in the north area. The foundations of these bastions were rectangular in shape and projected 5.4m (B4A) and a minimum 4.7m (B4) from the wall, B4A's foundations coursed chalk and ragstone being 'stepped' into the bottom of the V-shaped ditch. The solid, D-shaped superstructure of B4A was partly at least composed of reused monumental masonry including fragments of an inscribed Roman tombstone, probably of early 3rd Century date and was not keyed into the wall. The 3m high stretch of wall and the foundation of B4A have been preserved within the present building. In the Medieval period, a defensive ditch was constructed and infilled in the late 12th-13th Century when B4A was demolished and B4 apparently demolished, though since documentary evidence indicates that B4 survived into the 17th Century, this may only have been partial. During a watching brief on the east side of the site, the western edge of a ditch was recorded at a low level and is likely to have been part of a later Medieval defensive ditch: the city ditch. Post Medieval horncore lined pits dating to the late 16th-17th Century were found, two of which were associated with the casting of gun-metal. Towards the end of the 17th Century domestic properties were established. In the south a basement containing a brick water channel and well were recorded: they possibly represented the remains of a wash-house. The backfill of the well contained a substantial quantity of material associated with glassmaking in the late 17th-early 18th Century. In the north area, two brick-lined cesspits were constructed against the city wall where they probably demarcated two properties. Both were disused by the early-mid-18th Century. One of the cesspits was infilled about 1770, probably as the result of a household clearance: it contained a large collection of pottery and glassware many near-complete items and an animal bone assemblage which included an angora rabbit and a linnet. In the later 19th Century the Metropolitan Bonded Warehouse was constructed, storing tea and cork; features connected with this and the Irongate sewer, which ran north to south beneath the warehouse, were recorded.",

The archaeological sequence on the site was representative of the Roman, Late Saxon, Medieval and Post Medieval periods. There was a natural channel running across the site from west to east, which had been canalised during the early Roman period. This was then backfilled and an alternative channel cut further to the north. This appears to be related to drainage of the Roman amphitheatre to the west. There was a timber drain in the base of the cut and a later drain in another recut. Other Roman activity was represented by a truncated area of clay and timber building, and pits, two of which contained high-quality decorated samian vessels. The later Roman period was also represented on the site, with ditches running north-south along the eastern side of the site-interpreted as later drainage of the amphitheatre area-and more pitting.  There were several Late Saxon pits, some of which had decayed wattle linings surviving. The Early Medieval period was well represented by further pitting, including a closely-dated clearance deposit with a large assemblage of pottery. There were also some chalk footings which may be related to buildings on the site through documentary and cartographic evidence.

Some Roman pottery was recovered from the site, though all sherds were residual in Medieval or layer contexts. Some human bone was also recovered from Medieval cut features, presumably derived from disturbed burials from the nearby Roman cemetery.  Medieval remains consisted of numerous pits and wells found in three discrete areas, no doubt originally located in the backyards of buildings fronting Smithfield Street and Hosier Lane. Some of the earliest features were almost certainly quarry pits, for the extraction of sand and gravel. Based on the pottery evidence, two main groups of pits can be identified, one group dating to the late 13th and early 14th Centuries, and a slightly larger group of late 14th Century date. Pits of both groups were located in each of the three excavation areas, with no distinction in terms of the pattern of distribution between them. This suggests that the area was first laid out and occupied in the late 13th or early 14th Century, with major property boundaries subsequently maintained throughout the Medieval period. In addition, a small number of 15th and 16th Century pits were located, though others may have been truncated by later development on the site.  Post Medieval remains dating to before the late 19th Century redevelopment of the site were less well represented, largely consisting of below ground brick structures such as wells and drains.

There was no evidence for any Prehistoric activity on the site, neither were any redeposited Prehistoric artefacts seen in later contexts. A layer of deposits were recroded directly overlying the natural gravel. They have been tentatively interpreted as Roman make-up deposits or floor layers. The only other Roman features were pits which were all cutting natural gravels. The pottery within them was predominantly Roman, dating from the mid 2nd Century and 3rd Century. Further interpretation as to their function is difficult due to the extensive truncation by later features.  During the watching brief phase three deposits were recorded which may represent Medieval dumping or make-up layers. They overlay natural geology, were at similar levels (c.10.10m- 9.30m OD) and had very simiiar composition. The earliest Medieval features seen on the site were pits of unknown function, the fills of which were overlain by a brickearth make-uplayer. This deposit was seen at a level of 10.20m OD. It was in turn truncated by later Medieval pits, containing both Medieval and residual Roman pottery. Samples from one of these pits have been analysed and will give useful dietary information.  The Medieval pottery assemblage was dominated by locally produced items, common in the 11th and early 12th Centuries, indicating that the site was perhaps exploited most heavily during this period. Also recorded was a robber trench, containing 11th and 12th Century pottery. A large cess pit was the latest Medieval feature found in the excavation area. Another large pit was recorded within watching brief area 21; the composition of the deposits filling it would suggest it was also a cess pit.  The only Post Medieval features on the site were 18th Century brick walls and the associated later backfill between them. The walls were orientated east-west and north-south, forming cellar foundations.  *The natural Terrace sands and gravels were seen at truncated levels of between 9.84 and 9.90m OD within the excavation area, and at levels as low as 9.00m OD in watching brief area 18 to the north of the site. During the excavation phase of works natural brickearth was recorded at levels between 10.26 and I0.44m OD., and at c. 10.50m OD within watching brief area 22, to the southeast of the excavation area.",

Between December 1986 and March 1987 excavations funded by Hartstreet Properties Ltd were carried out at 9-13 Crutched Friars which is just inside the line of the Roman city wall. Excavations suggested that the earliest activity on site was related to the construction of the defensive wall of c 200. The area appears to have been levelled by dumps and later sealed by a roughly north/south aligned compacted mixed mortar/gravel surface. To the east a small section of surviving Roman wall revealed in the main property boundary of the site gave clear indications that the gravel/mortar surface was constructed after the lower courses of the wall. Above this surface the internal bank survived to a height of approximately 1.4-1.5m, and a width of 8.5m. The bank was constructed using alternate dumps of brickearth/gravels, the tip-lines of which suggested that the dumping sequence was from south to north; the bank tended to slope down from east to west. Apart from the defensive wall and bank there was little late Roman activity noted on site.  By the Medieval period the area of the bank was being encroached upon by a large north/south aligned foundation, possibly for a stone building to the west. To the east of this building a series of north/south aligned timber post-holes showed a possible lean-to structure or covered area between the building and the defensive wall. Once this timber structure went out of use, a north/south aligned yellow tile pathway was laid down between the building and the wall.  During the Post Medieval period the yellow tile path was incorporated into a larger cobblestone surface which covered most of the excavated area. By this period it is possible that the defensive wall had been demolished, for mixed in with the cobbled surface were stone fragments similar to those noted in the Roman wall construction.Later a large north/south aligned brick wall crossed the site. This building had internal rooms to the west, but still incorporated the yellow tile path and its cobblestone surrounds to the east.",

The investigation produced evidence of the city wall and defensive ditch sequence. Of the 51.5m stretch of the Roman city wall shown by trial holes to flank the east boundary of the site, a 17m section was revealed. This section was incorporated into the west wall of St Martin Ludgate in Wren's post-Fire rebuilding, and possibly into the pre-Fire church also. The city wall was observed surviving up to 3.1m above plinth level, the core having two double tile courses 0.7m apart, the lower of which was 0.7m above the top of the red sandstone plinth. The foundations of the wall were 0.95-1.0m deep and 2.45m thick. A 0.1m thick primary fill of silts in the base of the construction trench included tiles, chalk, ragstone, plaster, mortar and opus signinum suggesting that a previous building may have been demolished to make way for defensive work. The plinth and facing survived over a length of 11m and a height of 0.85m. Random single-tile courses, misplaced and broken plinth stones, two sandy limestone blocks and various mortars all suggest a Medieval reconstruction of the face of the city wall north of Ludgate. The core material and foundation, definitely of Roman date, produced a samian bowl provisionally dated mid-late 2nd Century. Underpinning work has allowed the recording of a massive ragstone and mortar foundation underneath the Ludgate Hill pavement and 8m west of the city wall which may well be the Roman gate. Four separate areas of excavation on the site included three complete sections through the ditch sequence. The early Roman V-shaped ditch was not recorded, perhaps as a result of Victorian basement terracing into the Fleet Valley slope to a depth of 2.6m below the wall's plinth level, but Roman, Saxon and Medieval ditches survived in truncated form. Furthest to the west a late Roman flat-bottomed and wide ditch was recorded. The Roman ditch was recut slightly to the east in the Late Saxon period and was in turn cut by a succession of three Early Medieval defensive ditches, each recut slightly to the east of its predecessor, the last being flat-bottomed, the first two roughly V-shaped. The latter, flat-bottomed, Medieval ditch seemed well maintained and regularly cleaned but retained a V-shape in the area 35m north of Ludgate thereby leaving a 6m wide margin outside the city wall for a possible Early Medieval bastion. A wealth of finds dating to c 1300-25 was preserved in the backfilling of the last ditch, including a large pottery group, horse skeletons and industrial waste suggestive of Fleet Valley industries, and a well-preserved wattle fence, perhaps representative of early suburban encroachment, crossing and blocking the ditch cut. The very early backfilling of the ditch north of Ludgate as excavated is supported by documentary evidence of encroachment.",

The entire area of the site was investigated (approximately 300m 100m maximum). The basement of the building that had occupied the site had completely removed earlier land surfaces, but an ancient channel or feature was found to cut the natural sand and gravel, probably resulting from an 'ice wedge' formed during a cold stage between 300,000 and 18,000 BP. The earliest archaeological feature that survived was a rubbish pit  of c.AD 450-750. The recovery of ten sherds of Early Saxon pottery provided evidence of activity pre-dating the trading settlement of Lundenwic. A barrel-lined well and four other rubbish pits dated to AD 650-850. Other evidence suggests that the locality was open land used primarily for agriculture during the Late Saxon and Medieval periods, but no features of this period were found. The earliest Post Medieval features were three wells constructed of pre-Great Fire bricks, probably 1630-41.

The earliest feature, cut into natural brickearth, was a pit containing Late Bronze Age pottery. Traces of early Roman occupation, consisting of parallel gullies running north-south, were followed by a substantial building to the east. Part of this comprised foundations of unmortared Kentish ragstone in rows up to 1m apart, infilled with flints, topped by rammed clay and sand and then a thick opus signinum floor. Possible imprints of pilae in this floor surface suggest the existence of a hypocaust. To the south and west were less substantial floors of mortar and brickearth.

An E-W aligned undated gully may have been associated with the ditch although no relationship survived.  Evidence for pitting activity after the gully was seen to be truncated by a further ditch aligned N-S, itself heavily truncated. It was dated from 1230-1400. These ditches probably acted as boundary demarcations.  A sequence of pitting was marked by numerous smaller pits and three large brickearth quarry pits. One of these contained a large pottery assemblage, comprising Surrey whiteware wasters and a large quantity of shell tempered ware. The primary pit fill was dated 1230-1300. A number of tile fragments with whiteware glaze were indicative of their use as a kiln spacers. The pit also contained a large animal bone assemblage, showing signs of domestic waste.  Some Medieval activity which could not be associated with the previous features included isolated post-holes, stake-holes and gullies.  A 17th Century phase comprised bedding trenches and a small four-post structure, possibly a shed. Also of this date, were ground-raising deposits and a large rubbish pit. In the north-east corner of the site some undated features were cut into the ground-raising layers; these ephemeral features may relate to a structure in that area.  A brick building was exposed in the north-west corner of the site, which dates from the late 17th to 18th Century. The south and east sides of a main room were formed by a returning wall which incorporate a recess, probably for a fireplace. An area of original internal floor for the build was found. To the south of the main room, another smaller wall was butted onto the larger. This returning wall formed the south and east sides for an extension to the building. An area of internal floor was seen within this as well. There was evidence for the sub-division of these rooms.  To the east of this building a sequence of yard activity was recorded, but it was not possible to definitively associate it with the building. It comprised a series of yard walls, which showed evidence of being strengthened and improved. A series of layers and surfaces were associated with the walls: garden soil, make-up, a crude stone floor and a better quality brick floor. Evidence for a drain in this area was also seen during the evaluation.  Structural changes had been made to the brick building in the north-west corner of the site in the late 18th Century; the original floor level had been largely demolished and sleeper walls inserted to support a raised floor level.  While the activity above was concentrated in the northern area of the site, a layer of garden soil in the southern area attests to that area being open.  Small areas of heavily truncated 18th Century masonry were found in the south-west corner of the site, including walls and a floor.  An 18th -19th Century structure was delineated in the north-east corner of the site by partial surviving remains of its exterior wall, and mostly by the position of a 19th Century robber trench. This building was sub-rectangular in shape and seen to be associated with an external rammed gravel yard surface. Contemporary changes were also seen to have been made to the earlier yard arrangement. Within the building, a substantial layer of crushed chalk was found, this itself had been replaced in at least one area.  A 19th Century substantial E-W wall, which ran across the middle of the site, may have been a rebuild of an earlier Post Medieval boundary which defined the southern extent of the above properties. The 19th Century build was also probably the northern wall for buildings facing onto the road to the south.

A cross-section of all periods from Roman to present day was examined including standing masonry of the priory of Holy Trinity Aldgate.  The Roman material suggested the presence of at least six successive 1st- and 2nd Century timber structures represented by lines of post-holes and slots which reused the same east-west line. Very few associated surfaces were uncovered and nearly all appeared to be external. One of these timber structures was a piled foundation within linear cuts identified in two areas to give a total length of at least 8m and consisting of deep timber piles, three to a row, supporting a masonry superstructure, which had been almost completely robbed out.  In Medieval contexts, large quantities of good-quality painted plaster, opus signinum, tessera cubes and other building material suggested the presence of a fine building nearby, and it is possible that the piled foundation could have supported such a building. One of the fragments of Roman building material found in a Medieval context was the unusual survival, intact, of the join between the top of a wall and the first tiles of a roof: two tegulae, sealed by an imbrex and held in place by a wedge-shaped piece of mortar, on top of the top tile of the wall, giving the correct angle for the slope of the roof.  Heavily truncating the Roman stratigraphy across the whole length of the site (about 30m) there followed a deliberate preparation for a ?Late Saxon graveyard. No trace of an associated church was found. There were 42 articulated burials, of three basic types, buried within simple cuts, or within wooden coffins, or most commonly within stone and mortar lined cists. To the west, the burials cut one into another causing a build-up of a sequence of at least ten burials in one area. By contrast, the burials to the east were positioned carefully next to each other with very little disturbance. Unfortunately, the join between the areas was disturbed by later intrusions.  The site covered a portion of the south side of the church of the priory of Holy Trinity Aldgate, founded in 1108. The 12th-Century foundations for the southern wall of the church and the outline of almost the whole of the southern transept foundations were excavated, together with foundations, and about 3.5m of superstructure, of a chapel with an apsidal east end on the outside of the northeast corner of the transept. Part of the southwest corner of a second chapel (to the east of the apsidal chapel) was recorded together with a later 14th- or 15th Century arch which formed the entrance from the church to the chapel. Only one small area of internal flooring survived: a series of mortar surfaces, possibly originally sealed by tiles. A small area of painted plaster inside the apsidal chapel remained on the wall. The apsidal chapel was squared externally and was founded on rough courses of chalk and mortar, with the superstructure of ragstone, flint, reused Roman tile and, more unusually, blocks of limestone, and possibly Caen stone. About 0.4m above floor level was a course, inside and outside, of chamfered stones and the corners were treated specially, with close-fitting ashlar blocks. Several architectural features on both the arch and the chapel have warranted the preservation of both within the new development. An external area between the two chapels contained material contemporary with and later than the priory. During the life of the priory it appeared to have no special status but received mixed dumps and some pits, and may possibly have been associated with Medieval properties fronting on Leadenhall Street, perhaps as a backyard.  In the 16th entury the Dissolution was reflected in a change of use of the apsidal chapel to that of a cellar with a doorway and later a window knocked through the east wall. The external area to the east became covered with roof slates, probably from the church, and was then raised to a height level with the doorway in the chapel. A large timber structure was erected between the two still-standing chapels, respecting their southern limits, and a series of external metallings formed an alleyway or courtyard to the south of the chapels and timber structure.  The apsidal chapel continued to be reused, with several other additions into the 19th Century, when a new series of basements and a cobbled courtyard finally truncated and sealed it. These buildings were dismantled after bombing in the Second World War.  Recording of the aboveground remains of Holy Trinity Priory Aldgate (the arch originally leading from the southern aisle of the choir into a chapel) continued during 1985 following the excavation of the site in 1984. The Medieval work was stabilised and where possible stripped of later brickwork. A pointed arch of two orders moulded in Reigate stone with plain hollow chamfers which die into the jambs without capitals had been inserted into an earlier, probably 12th-Century arch of which traces still survived in the core observed in the northern face. Traces of a window in the wall east of the arch and a spiral staircase in the south face of the wall to the east of the arch were also observed. During the first stage of the subsequent development, the southern transept chapel remains were lifted temporarily across the site to enable foundations to be dug, and then the chapel was lifted back into approximately its original place. The standing arch now forms a feature in the foyer of the new building.",

Natural sands and gravels were resorted along the line of a Walbrook tributary which flowed southwest across the southeast corner of the site.  The earliest activity was Roman land reclamation along this channel. A series of industrial pits and drainage gullies were located along the west bank and the channel itself contained abundant leather waste and 20-30 human skulls. A road constructed of rammed gravel ran north-northeast/south-southwest, roughly through the middle of the site.  Between this road and the Walbrook tributary, brickearth and timber buildings were built in at least two phases, possibly in the mid-2nd Century. A timber-lined well, dated no earlier than AD130, was constructed between these buildings and the channel. A second gravel road running east-southeast/west-northwest was recorded to the east. This road was partially silted over and stones from a monumental building were laid in a linear arrangement on its surface, probably to form a drain. In the northwest corner of the site lay two more Roman buildings, one to the west constructed of brickearth sills and timber uprights and the other to the east built of wattle and daub. In an external yard associated with the latter building was a tile and mortar plinth, possibly for a statue. Marsh deposits accumulated after the disuse of these buildings.  The only surviving later feature was a ditch running east-west cut into these marsh deposits, representing an attempt to re-establish drainage in the area in the 11th Century. All later strata were truncated by 19th Century basements.  Among the varied finds, a good pottery assemblage is predominantly 2nd Century in date. A fragmentary bowl, probably London ware, has strips of tin foil applied to the rim sherds. Such metal decoration on this type of pottery is hitherto unknown in Britain. Another unusual ceramic find is a KOAN amphora with a painted inscription in Greek, a name in the genitive case, translated as 'Theoumrou' or 'Theouerou'. Other unusual finds include two leatherworking implements, consisting of an iron awl with leather thongs wound around the head and, among many good leather finds, a whole leather shoe with hobnails. Other organic objects recovered include a complete wooden spindle, a boxwood ladle head, a fragmentary wooden bowl, half an ivory bracelet with incised decoration and several bone pins, one of which has an animal hoof head. Among the metal finds are a complete pair of copper-alloy bevelled tweezers, a fragmentary seal box and more than 20 coins, most of which are copper alloy but one, overlaid with silver, is identified as a forged denarius.

The earliest phase of activity consisted of a site-wide levelling of homogeneous sandy gravel, capped with fine, hard, silty redeposited brickearth, which produced no finds but is assumed to be Roman. These layers were cut by the foundations of timber-framed structures and mortared flint-rubble footings.

The site comprises two separated parts of a single block bounded by Eagle Place, Jermyn Street, Piccadilly and Lower Regent Street. The proposals entail: Redevelopment behind a retained facade at 210 - 211 Piccadilly;  Demolition and redevelopment of 212 - 214 Piccadilly together with 3 & 4 Eagle Place and 23 Jermyn Street; Demolition and redevelopment of 18 - 21 Jermyn Street behind a retained facade; Retention of 27 Regent Street with internal remodelling; and Public realm enhancements and associated works. The site does not contain any Scheduled Monuments. It lies partly in the Regent Street Conservation Area and partly in the St James's Conservation Area. It does not lie within an Area of Special Archaeological Priority as designated by Westminster City Council. This assessment has found that the site (western - Gateway West - and eastern - 27 Lower Regent Street - parts) has a generally low potential to contain archaeological remains of all periods due to truncation caused by the construction of the basements and foundations of the existing buildings. There is a low potential for the recovery of in situ Palaeolithic remains within the terrace gravels, which may have survived this truncation. The main impact would arise from the excavation of the proposed basements, which would entirely remove any archaeological remains present. Piling would only have an impact upon archaeological remains if carried out prior to basement excavation, removing any archaeological remains from the footprint of each pile. MOL Archaeology is currently monitoring of geotechnical bore holes and trial pits in Gateway West site in order to confirm the level of natural deposits and the presence or absence, nature and depth of any archaeological remains. To date, the monitoring has shown that the natural geology is heavy truncated by the existing basements and no archaeological remains have been identified. Based on the results of the on-going archaeological monitoring across the rest of the site, it is possible that no further archaeological mitigation is necessary. If archaeological remains are, however, shown to survive locally in other parts of the site, an archaeological watching brief may be required prior to and during construction to ensure that archaeological remains are not removed without record.

This entry derives from Merrifield's gazetteer of the Roman City of London (see source link) as no investigation archive was available.  Newgate Street, south side, east of Warwick Lane, 1961: the south edge of the main Roman east to west road, about 8ft 6in south of the building frontage, and a possible ditch. To the south of the probable road-edge, gravel layers extended for at least 17ft. A culvert of Roman bricks lay on the west side of an ancient watercourse, towards which it ran.  Newgate Street, 10-13, 1962: a layer of Roman gravel seen in section below the old building frontage, immediately above natural brickearth; also probably a trace of the main Roman road.  Newgate Street, south side, 1961: a portion of a Roman building, with a ragstone wall running north to south towards an east to west wall. To the west was a floor of brick tiles through which an open drain ran to the west. Above this were two more floors. To the south was another north to south wall, a pavement of small tiles set in opus signinum, another brick drain, and traces of a pottery kiln with sherds of the late 1st Century.   Paternoster Square, approximately 190ft east of Warwick Lane, and behind 14-29 Newgate Street, 1961: a mass of gravel metalling indicated a Roman north to south road; a drainage gully adjoined it on the east side. It was not possible to ascertain the road's width.   Newgate Street, west of Ivy Lane, opposite Greyfriars' Passage, 1961: a possible fragment of the north to south road was observed, but not enough to help significantly with the road's alignment.  Newgate Street, south side, north of Paternoster Row, 1961: the course of an ancient stream was recorded running north to south. Its bed was defined by a band of black mud. Its east limit coincided with the boundary between the wards of Farringdon Within and Castle Baynard in the central and southern parts of the site. In the north part towards Newgate it curved from the north-east, and another branch apparently joined it from the north-west, probably following approximately the boundary at the north end of Castle Baynard ward.   Ave Maria Lane, east side, 1962: a continuation of the stream just mentioned was observed here; the western edge was 63ft east of the old building-line, 105ft north of the junction of Ave Maria Lane and Ludgate Hill.   Newgate Street, south side, opposite Roman Bath Street [now lost, beneath British Telecom Headquarters on north side of street], 1961: wooden piles may represent the edge of the main Roman road beneath Newgate Street, which was otherwise not seen.  Newgate Street, 48, west of St Paul's Underground Station, 1961: a thick deposit of gravel was observed in section, 18-20ft south of the building-line. It may have been part of the east to west Roman road beneath Newgate or of the north to south road seen to the south.  Newgate Street/Paternoster Row, west of Panyer Alley, 1961: gravels resembling road-metalling seemed to form a north to south Roman road running in the direction of Aldersgate. Metalling was found further east, but this would make a north to south road 40ft wide. The latter may have been a courtyard.  Paternoster Row, east of Canon Alley, 1961: a Roman pavement of coarse red tesserae under the north frontage of Paternoster Row was recorded. There were no signs of associated walls.   Post-Roman:  This entry summarises all the sites in the post-Roman period without dividing them. Many chalk walls, presumably of Medieval date, were seen but could not be recorded because of the rapid method of excavation. Two undercrofts were noted: one near the east end of Paternoster Row was recorded by Professor Grimes, and the other, near the middle of the east half of the site, by P Marsden. The latter measured 16ft wide and more than 24ft long. It was built of ragstone with a facing of greenish sandstone with traces of mouldings and an arch. Seventeenth Century pottery and clay pipes from its brick rubble fill may be debris of the Great Fire. At the east end of the site, close to St Paul's Underground Station, was a ragstone foundation with hard yellowish-white mortar. This overlay a rubbish pit containing Saxon and Early Medieval pottery. At the north-west corner of the site a Medieval or later barrel-well was noted. Though no archaeological evidence for post-Roman use of the north to south stream was noted, its correspondence with the ward boundaries suggests that it was open in Early Medieval times.",

Wessex Archaeology were contracted by Pencol Engineering Consultants. The augering survey, using a 40mm Dutch auger, entailed 80 samples along a 2.5km length line from Ford Motorworks to Rainham Silt Lagoons. Yet only 28 of these samples could be used due to the distinct lack of data in others because of obstructions or voids caused by 'slurry'. Although the auger survey did not locate any archaeological sites it does indicate the position of peat deposits, important due to the evidence from nearby sites where finds of Neolithic organic material and Roman activity material have been found.

The sewer and structures were to be removed or altered in order to redevelop the site. The investigation of the structures took place periodically from March through to November 2007. The section of Northern Outfall Sewer which falls within the Olympic development site includes with the Greenway Bridge over the River Lea, the Greenway Bridge over Marshgate Lane and Pudding Mill Lane, the Pedestrian Subway, Abbey Lane Pedestrian Bridge, the Pedestrian Bridge spanning the Channelsea River and the Pedestrian Viaduct of the Outfall Sewer. These elements were recorded, researched and analysed.  The oldest structural remains date to the initial outfall sewer construction period of the late 1850s and early 1860s. The construction of the sewer was triggered by a series of public health crises in London, culminating in the 'Big Stink of London' in the late 1850s, and occurred as a direct result of the formation of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Their head engineer, Joseph Bazalgette, oversaw the construction of the sewer. The rising population of the area served by the sewer over the following decades necessitated the 1904-05 expansion of the section from Old Ford to Barking by two extra sewer pipes on the northern side. The following years saw little in the way of major alteration, being a period of maintenance and repair rather than large scale works. The years 1940-41 saw the sewer become a casualty of German bombs, but despite numerous hits little real damage was done and the structure was repaired. The post-war period saw very little change for the sewer until the late 1980s, when efforts to construct and maintain green areas in and around London resulted in the renovation of the footpath on the sewer embankment to create the Greenway, a footpath and cycle route.",

This followed a trial trench evaluation in 1995 (ELO10422). An archaeological watching brief in May 1997 defined the actual areas of surviving archaeology which corresponded closely to the area predicted in the evaluation. To the rear of 9-15 Neal Street all surviving archaeological strata were therefore hand excavated in June and July 1997. A watching brief was maintained to November 1997 on contractors' groundworks in the basement of the Long Acre building (where the exposed gravels were inspected for archaeological features) and the principal area of new building construction, the former warehouse to the south of Brewer's Yard (while contractors removed the deep 18th and 19th Century vaulted basements). Four pits were observed cutting the natural gravels; all had been truncated by later activity but seemed to have originally been at least 2.0m in diameter and 0.5-1.0m deep, and may indicate Saxon quarrying for sands and gravel for surfacing yards and alleys in Lundenwic. The area appeared to have been levelled with a sandy silt deposit prior to the construction of a metalled area. The animal bone recovered from the dumped material was characterised by butchered cattle waste. Two successive very compact gravel layers were observed at the northern end of the main excavation area at c.19.32m OD, cut by a shallow linear feature, possibly a drain, or beam slot for a timber structure. The gravel 'road' may have been made in the 8th Century, and a large pit was found dug to the side of it. The gravel surface and the area to the south-east were covered by a dumped layer containing domestic rubbish and butchery waste. The area appeared to be damp and it continued to be used for pitting and dumping, probably to dispose of domestic and butchery waste from nearby occupation during the 8th and 9th Centuries. In the late 9th Century the area seems to have been used for agriculture, which continued with little interruption until the 17th Century.

The main purpose of the excavation was to trace the line of the Roman street suggested to run from the north-east corner of the 2nd Century forum north to a gate on the site of Bishopsgate to the north of the site, and to investigate any relationship with the 1st Century north to south street found on a different alignment at 28-32 Bishopsgate in 1982. The natural brickearth had been truncated to a shallow depth by modern basements on the west part of the site, adjacent to Bishopsgate. Roman intrusive features suggested the presence of 1st- and 2nd Century buildings and pits relating to a frontage beneath the modern street. None of the features postdating this period showed any sign of having been inserted through a substantial metalled surface. At the south-east corner of the site stratigraphy survived to a greater height. Initial quarrying activities and ground preparation were followed by a rectangular timber-framed building of at least two rooms extending beyond the limits of the excavation, with a gravelled area to its north. One room had a floor of opus signinum, the other had carefully laid make-ups of crushed building material ending with a (robbed) brickearth slab. Overlying this were quantities of tesserae and painted wall plaster. The building's destruction was dated to the 3rd or 4th Century. A small rectangular sunken-floored structure respecting the alignment was recorded within the area of the building. Its construction was probably contemporary with the demolition of the by then derelict building. The dark earth overlying these structures produced 3rd- and 4th Century pottery and coins. All subsequent periods in this area were represented by intense pit digging and consequently few indications of surfaces or structures survived. Fragments of crucible, an Early Medieval hearth and quantities of demolished kiln material in Medieval pits could suggest industrial activity in the vicinity.

A specification required that twenty-one trial pits were to be hand dug across the whole of the site, each with dimensions of c. 0.60m x 0.60m x 1.20m deep. In practice, ground conditions meant that there were 26 TPs of somewhat uneven dimensions. The numbers TP2 and TP10 were unused.

Several small, possibly Bronze Age, gullies were cut into natural sand and gravel. No definite Roman features were located, although quantities of Roman pottery and building material were recovered.   Several quarry pits predating the earliest Cluniac drain were found and contained chaff-tempered pottery and loom weights, probably of Middle Saxon date; large quantities of Late Saxon to Early Medieval pottery were also recovered. A large ditch (presumed to be a boundary ditch), a large hurdle- or timber-revetted drain and a fence-line with a related small structure were also recorded. A number of buildings from the claustral range of both the Cluniac priory and succeeding Benedictine abbey were examined. The claustral buildings included two phases of the frater, apparently of later Medieval date and possibly relating to the kitchens, the south part of the dorter, the reredorter and the great drain. Further features included the east wall of the chapter house, a small apsidal feature (possibly a vestry), four phases of the infirmary chapel and three phases of the infirmary hall and a second cloister. Two hundred in situ burials were excavated, fifteen of them in stone cists.  Substantial alterations were recorded to the surviving east wall of the dorter on its incorporation into Sir Thomas Pope's mansion, Bermondsey House.

Prior to redevelopment the Island Site consisted of three office buildings (Dominion Buildings, Imperial House and Verum House). The first evlauation phase (in 1992, ELO9752) was mainly in Imperial House to the north-east, but included one test pit in the basement car park of Dominion Buildings (the southern part of the Island Site). Under the second phase in June 1993 five further testpits, approx 2m square, were located in Dominion Buildings. Natural brickearth was overlaid by soil development and cut by stakeholes. A redeposited brickearth deposit included charcoal, bone and oyster shell, Roman pot, and a redeposited Late-Neolithic or Early Bronze flint blade. The earliest feature was a gully containing pottery dated to between 950 and 1050 AD. Stake-holes may be associated with this feature but could not be dated.

These were infilled and sealed by brickearth and gravel dumps prior to the laying of an external gravel surface, which may have been part of an east-west road. All surviving Roman deposits are dated to the late 1st Century.  These deposits were cut by a number of intercutting cess-, rubbish and storage pits dated to the 9th-14th Centuries. One 12th-13th Century cesspit was wattle lined, with a surrounding privacy screen.  This sequence was cut by later Medieval chalk and ragstone foundations, which may have formed part of a building fronting onto Garlick Hill to the east. An early 18th Century brick cellar, disused and infilled by 1800, probably belonged to one of a number of properties also fronting onto Garlick Hill, and a contemporary brick-lined well was probably located in an open space documented immediately to the west.

In January-March 1988 excavations, sponsored by the Worshipful Company of Skinners, Reinhold plc and Ranelagh Developments Ltd, investigated two areas. In one of these, Skinners' Hall kitchen in the southern part of the site, over 4m of stratigraphy survived. A watching brief was undertaken from September 1988 till the end of the year while the rest of the site was reduced. The SKN87 (ELO16503) code refers to the excavation inside Skinners' Hall kitchen, and CKL88 (ELO) to the wider watching brief, but both sites are considered together in all post-excavation reports.  In the north trench, overlying the alluvial deposits of the Walbrook, which ran down the east edge of the site, were a number of Roman timber drains running east into the Walbrook. These were covered by more alluvial deposits which in turn were overlaid by an extensive yard surface. Patched and resurfaced numerous times, the surface sloped gradually down towards the Walbrook. It was constructed out of building debris and contained a large quantity of painted wall plaster. The other Roman feature on the site was a plain tessellated floor. The floor was covered by dark earth with a high content of building material including stamped roof tiles.  During the Medieval period the area seems to have been divided into a number of properties. Numerous floors were excavated but few associated walls survived. This appears to be due to the continuity of property boundaries and the insertion of a large chalk gravel foundation in the late Medieval period. The building phases were interspersed with phases of pits. Several were wicker lined and one appeared to have wooden sides and a 'lid'. In the east property the pits were larger and several contained industrial residues. In the southern trench the dark earth dumps were exposed but not excavated. They were truncated by a Medieval building with a mortar floor to the east and external gravel yard surfaces and well to the west, property boundaries being defined by two large stone drains with yellow brick-vaulted roofs, one running north-south along the east side of the site, the other east-west through the middle of the site. The larger east drain was thought to have contained the enclosed course of the Walbrook; the other running into it to have contained a previously unrecorded tributary. A building to the south, also with external surfaces, and a well to the west, were seen in the watching brief.  In the Post Medieval period the north building was replaced with gardens (probably shown on the Agas map c 1559) and large brick-lined cesspits. A brick building reused the foundations to the south but only a large tile hearth and part of a flagstone floor were recorded. After the Great Fire the same foundations were reused for the new buildings, but the hearth was filled in as were the pits to the west. Cesspits continued to be dug in this area, producing a large variety of environmental remains. The garden area was re-established (as shown on Ogilby and Morgan's map of 1676) and a small part of a curved garden wall and path were recorded.The finds assemblage from this site is dominated by building materials, which include 19 examples of Roman tegulae with a civilian form of stamp. Abundant quantities of painted wall plaster were recovered from a confined area of the site. Medieval finds were sparser but include a chalk toy 'house' recovered from a rubbish pit. The cesspits of Skinners' Hall kitchen were filled with 17th Century ceramics, bottle glass and an exotic array of faunal remains, including duck, hare, eel and wild bird.",

Beneath and therefore preceding the city defences on the east side of the site were found two successive wooden buildings of the 1st and 2nd Century. The first was aligned with the Walbrook tributary to the west (the line of Blomfield Street) and had one wall built in an interlocking upright plank technique previously assumed to be typically Medieval. Adjacent to this building was a substantial box drain over 1m deep.The development of a drainage system was traced from a small land drain running north-east to south-west on the east side of the site, through the box drain mentioned above, via a system of parallel ditches to a large defensive ditch 5m wide and 1.5m deep that accompanied the construction of the Roman city wall, immediately to the south. This drainage system was subject to extreme fluctuations in flow, presumably reflecting changes in land use upstream, leading to the deposition of up to 1.5m of sediments on the west side of the site. During this period of natural aggradation, burials were inserted many of which were then subject to disturbance by erosion, leading to a mixed deposit of human bone, leather sandals, and funerary pots holding offerings of chickens and coins; also recovered was a scatter of over 500 forger's coin moulds, some of which were of later 3rd Century low-denomination bronze coins. After more silting in this area, a masonry structure was built against the outer face of the city wall. This badly truncated structure was apparently at first a bastion and was then altered, perhaps for a non-defensive purpose. More fluvial deposition followed, deriving from the Walbrook tributary to the west, and continued in the Medieval period, when drier parts of the site were used for agriculture and perhaps for grazing, evidenced by a fence-line. This was followed by the cutting of a large city ditch, 1m deep and 12.5m wide, in the early 17th Century, reversing the flow of the drainage system, and taking water from the Walbrook around the outside of the City. It may also have removed any evidence for a Medieval ditch.Above the ditch sediments the area was covered by large landfill dumps of domestic waste and building debris, possibly from buildings postdating the Great Fire. A well in the north-west corner was perhaps part of the 18th Century housing development known as Petty France. The lengths of the upstanding city wall exposed along the south side of the site revealed details of both face and core. The face of the Roman wall includes the ferruginous sandstone plinth, four ragstone courses and the first tile string course, but the core of this wall survives to above the second tile string course. The core of the Roman wall was poured from above, leaving clear tip-lines at 45 degrees, the angle of repose. The Medieval face of the wall used reworked Roman core blocks of ragstone and tiles, and the Medieval core used new materials such as flint and chalk. A post-Great Fire redbrick church precinct wall on a sandstone plinth, visible from the pavement, was recorded directly above the sequence. The wall is preserved as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a panel exposing the face of the Medieval wall is to be left uncovered for public inspection.Other finds from this site included part of a ceramic Langewehe horn, and most of a decorated Montelupo plate.",

Block B is the southernmost of the land-blocks to which the current applications relate. The first development was a meeting house, now lost, c1780, fronting onto York Way. In the last decade of the eighteenth Century a terrace, used largely for commercial purposes, was built fronting New Road (now Pentonville Road). In 1826 the Caledonian Road was built and by 1826 the land-block had been established. This was characterised by tall, generally four-storey terraces on the perimeter, with a mix of single or two-storey top-lit extensions to the rear. The interior of the land-block was also developed, the northern area was crowded with low status housing and in the southern half 19th Century industrial or warehouse buildings predominated. All of these in the central area was slighter than the terraces on the perimeter. Later the north-west quadrant of the landblock were replaced by a laundry complex.

Excavations funded by Spaxe Properties Ltd were conducted in several phases both before and after demolition, between July 1989 and August 1990.  Natural sand and gravels capped by brickearth were quarried in the earliest activity on the site, beginning in and perhaps confined to the Roman period. The quarries were infilled and overlaid by dumps containing a large quantity of Roman painted wall plaster. These dumps were truncated by Early Medieval pits for disposal of domestic rubbish and cess.  The priory of St Helen was founded to the west of the site, in the 13th Century. The chalk core of a wall and substantial foundations running north-south across the site, on the documented line of the priory boundary, were presumably the remains of its precinct wall, surviving embedded in later walls. Within the precinct were deposits of garden soil, cut by rubbish pits. There were also chalk-lined cellars of two buildings, either contemporary with the priory or belonging to the period immediately after its dissolution. The walls of one cellar, to the south, were faced with squared blocks, about half of them scratched with Roman numerals, probably masons' batchmarks. Brick-lined slots surviving in two corners probably held beams for a floor, stairs or some other structure. A ditch ran parallel to the priory boundary and there were extensive dumps of waste possibly from an industrial process such as bell-founding. To the east, outside the precinct, foundations of rammed chalk and gravel probably represented pier bases in the church of St Mary Axe, documented from the 12th Century and converted to secular use in the 16th Century. To its south, the associated graveyard was marked by nine burials; there were also two pits containing about 150 skeletons, without skulls, probably reinterred in the course of mid-20th Century redevelopment. Post Medieval brick cesspits, cellar walls and a well were also recorded. The Roman painted wall plaster in the dumped deposits was of fine quality with a wide variety of colours, most still in good condition. Designs partly pieced together include a column, roundels and other architectural motifs.

The existing ground level varies along the routefrom a maximum height of 14.9m OD to the north to 10.9m OD at the southern end. It is assumed that for its entire length, the trench will involve the truncation of any surviving archaeological deposits down to a depth of approximately 900mm below these varying levels. This suggests that the impact along much of the route is likely to be limited to horizontal deposits of late Medieval/Post Medieval date, and where they survive, structural features of Post Medieval date may also be affected along areas of both the routes.  The level of archaeological survival along much of the route is likely to depend on the extent of truncation by previous service trenches in the roadways and footpaths, and modern road make-up: at present the extent of this truncation is unknown.

In situ natural sands and gravels were recorded in 19 trenches. The earliest archaeologically significant deposits were recorded at Soho Square, Falconberg Court, Falconberg Mews and Sutton Row; they included 'peaty' soils (indicative of a wet, marshy environment), alluvial clay/silts and reworked brickearth (possibly from early agricultural activity). The area was largely rural prior to urbanisation in the 17th Century: no dating evidence for Prehistoric, Roman or Medieval occupation was recovered. Stratigraphic sequences at Manette Street and Sutton Row provided evidence for occupation and building demolition. Post Medieval remains, provisionally dated 17th to early 19th Century, were recorded across the site. Typically, they included, brick foundations and/or basement/cellar walls with occasional associated soil deposition. At the junction of the Charing Cross Road with Manette Street, natural gravels were cut by large gravel extraction pits, backfilled by probable 15th to early 17th Century landfill dumps. These were followed by a brick arched foundation representing either the foundations of buildings pre-dating the 19th Century widening of the Charing Cross Road or perhaps a Tudor culvert. To the S of this foundation was an 18th Century brick cellar on a slightly different alignment. Later quarry pits in the vicinity of St Giles High Street and Andrew Borde Street respected the line of building frontages, indicating that these were standing when the pits were dug. These 18th Century buildings, which may have been built on 17th Century originals, included a lightwell to a deeper (unexcavated) coal cellar, cut through the natural gravel. A clay tobacco pipe dated 1640-1680 was recovered from the fills of the quarry pit and it is possible that this indicates disruption at the time of the construction of the Civil War defences to the north. The upper layers of the quarry were overlain by alternate layers of gravel and sand, presumed to be the bedding for a road or pavement. At New Oxford Street, a series of late 18th to 19th Century sewer pipes and water mains were recorded.

Thirty Two pits were excavated across this site between July 1998 and January 2000, for geotechnical investigations, archaeological evaluation and construction of new foundations and lift pits. The Roman period was well presented in the archaeological record, although it was difficult to come to many' conclusions on phasing and landuse due to the fragmentary nature of the evidence. In the 1st and 2nd Centuries AD the site housed several phases of building of both masonry and clay and timber construction, some of high status. Two fire horizons were detected, the earliest appears to have occurred c. AD 60 and may represent the destruction of London during the Boudiccan revolt. The 2nd Century phases of Roman building were also subject to destruction by a larger fire. Study of the ceramic record from the site indicates this may have been the Hadrianic fire c AD120-125. There is also some evidence for rebuilding after the HadriaIiic fire although not much Roman pottery dating to the later 2nd, 3rd or 4th Centuries AD was recovered. It is possible that later truncation may be responsible for the lack of material from these Centuries.  Throughout the Saxon period (c.410-1066 AD), the site appears to have been largely deserted. This period is represented in the archaeology by a layer of dark grey silt, often referred to as 'dark earth', and refuse pits. This dark earth is thought to represent a soil horizon which built up as the result either of an extensive period of disuse, or a period when the city was little used apart from perhaps as a market garden. On the site this dark earth sealed the Roman deposits. No evidence of the Late Saxon street, or sunken structures identified in excavations to the north, were found on the site although this is again most likely due to truncation by existing buildings and the limited area of the excavations. Relatively little Medieval archaeology was present, being typified by rubbish pits and a further build up of dumped deposits. One chalk wall foundation tentati:vely dated to this period was excavated.

The report was commissioned by Grosvenor Limifed. The report considers Ihe archaeological potential of Ihe sife, and Ihe likely impact on this oflhe proposed redevelopmenl. Geolechnical works show that sife was located on a high sandy island between the Rivers Tyburn and Westbourne and finds from the vicinify indicate a potenlial for prehisloric settlement. There is a c 1 m deep deposif of alluvial clay over the natural sand in one area of the sife which may be of interest, perhaps a palaeochannel, or a laler fealUre, such as an osier bed. The alluvium offers a high pOlenlial for palaeoenvironmenlal information, as these deposils often preserve organic malerial from planls and animals. There is Iitlle potential for archaeological fealures and artefacts relating to the Roman period on Ihe sife. Saxon or Medieval ditches may survive in Ihe unbasemenled areas of Ihe sife.

A total of 3m of archaeological deposits were preserved. Nine trenches were excavated, varying in size between 8m x 4m and 2m x 2m.The earliest features recorded on site were designed to control drainage. A timber-lined drain led to a timber-lined structure, possibly a tank. Two phases of post and plank revetment running north-south, were found, the later provisionally dated to AD120-40. They appear to have revetted the banks of a Walbrook tributary.  In the central area of excavation a brickearth and timber Roman building, provisionally mid- to late 1st Century, contained at least three rooms, in one of which was a timber tank. This feature may have had an industrial function. After the abandonment of this building another, similar structure, in use until AD120-40, was built on the same site. An important collection of Roman glassworking debris, including part of a 'tank' furnace was found associated with this building.  In the northern part of one trench a large dump of Roman leather shoemaking waste was found. The leather and glassworking material constitute a collection likely to provide considerable new insights into the industry of Roman Britain. The most spectacular individual find, associated with a metalled yard and timber tank, was a damaged stone statue of a god, possibly Mercury. The metalling has a provisional date of AD100-200. South of the yard lay the robbed foundations of a large masonry building, which fell into disuse by AD120.The Roman occupation of this site finished with a phase of deep dumping in the late 2nd to early 3rd Century. Evidence of Medieval activity, truncated by the recent basements, consisted of a well and a series of wattle-lined pits. The pits appeared to lie along a property boundary parallel with the modern line of Nun Court. Several Post Medieval features were also found.For earlier work on this site, in 1929, see GM121 above.",

The site lay some 250m outside the eastern wall of Roman London, within the area of the eastern Roman cemetery. Ten graves and twelve cremations were excavated along with two tomb structures, ditches, and other deposits associated with Roman activity in the burial-ground. The wide range of funerary customs encountered illustrates the cosmopolitan character of Roman London.    Two features seemed to be of pre-Roman date: a massive ditch ran from east to west across the site, at least 3.00 m wide and 3.50 m deep, but containing no dateable material. Beside the ditch was a small circular pit, possibly dug to contain an upright wooden post. The backfill contained a number of fragments of worked flint, apparently residue from tool making, and one very fine flint scraper was found, disturbed by later activity.  Two Roman ditches crossed the site from east to west, small features probably for drainage.  Twelve cremations were excavated, four buried in pottery vessels with lids of stone or tile. One of these was contained in a large storage jar (amphora), and one was exceptionally well preserved, with no soil having got into the pot. These cremations were associated with a number of post-holes, indicating the presence of wooden posts, possibly grave markers.  The other cremations were buried in shallow pits without pottery urns, but iron nails indicated that the burnt bone had been placed in wooden boxes prior to burial. No wood had survived however.  Ten graves were excavated, a majority of which showed that the bodies had been buried in wooden coffins as seen by the surviving coffin nails and/or stains left in the ground from the decomposed wood. Two of the wooden coffins were filled with a chalk like deposit along with the body.  Evidence was found for two substantial funerary monuments (mausolea) which would have originally stood above ground over burials. One seems to have been stone built but had been robbed.  The other structure was built at least partly of wood and contained a central grave pit and one end of a massive coffin.  Two inhumation graves and several of the cremations had objects deliberately placed in the grave with the body, e.g a pottery bowl, a pair of hobnail boots, shale & copper alloy bracelets, glass beads and a copper alloy ring.  *Natural sands and gravels were observed at c 10.82m OD*",

These levelling deposits likely originated as ground raising and consolidation dumps for late 18th Century residential terraced houses, and also for the construction of the current terraces constructed in 1820s and 1830s.

This new build included the installation of a lower ground floor and basement, which required a variety of formation levels, leading to differing depths of excavation and extents of archaeological work. Although the central area of the site was excavated down to natural gravel, a higher formation level applied at the eastern end (16-17 Tokenhouse Yard) and archaeology here below 8.5m OD was largely preserved in situ, with protection laid below the slab formation blinding to serve as a marker for future archaeologists. By contrast, due to the natural slope in the terrain and previous truncation, terrace gravels at the western end of the site (8-10 Moorgate) were close to both the existing and new basement formation level. This meant that very little archaeology had survived in this area.  A tributary of the Walbrook stream was predicted to run beneath the eastern part of the site. Both the archaeology and geology of this part of Moorgate have been greatly affected by this watercourse, a tributary of the River Thames, which rose in the area of modern Islington, formed two main channels in the northern part of the Roman city and merged into one main channel just north of Lothbury, which ran through the heart of the Roman city and into the Thames just to the west of modern Cannon Street Station. One of the objectives of the fieldwork was to try to locate the path of the tributary and a geoarchaeological survey, involving topographic modelling of the site and its surroundings, was undertaken as part of the fieldwork.  The earliest activity recorded on the site is provisionally dated to the 1st Century AD, and comprised rubbish dumping and quarrying. The latter was likely to have facilitated the construction of a north-south aligned road, most likely truncated by the previous building at 8-10 Moorgate, but whose foundation layers were recorded at an excavation immediately to the north. Activity on site into the 2nd Century AD took the form of a series of east-west pale fences that would have demarcated neighbouring properties; parallel timber-lined drains and a small circular stake and wattle structure that possibly served as an animal pen were thought to be contemporary. The fences were later incorporated within boxed or 'crib' revetment bases which housed a build-up of dumps that effectively levelled the land at this boggy edge of the Walbrook tributary, allowing a drier platform for the construction of clay and timber buildings.  At least five separate properties were recorded, dating mainly to the 2nd Century AD; one of these survived into the later 2nd Century/ 3rd Century, with two sides of its clay walls replaced with masonry foundations. This development also incorporated a courtyard to the north. Nine timber-lined wells served various households over a period of two Centuries. Remains of a large building, thought to date to the 3rd Century, was recorded spanning at least two of the earlier property boundaries.  Up to four buildings dating to the Medieval period had also survived, possibly due in part to the slightly shallower Victorian basement of 3-4 Kings Arms Yard. Traces of 'turf' walls, gullies, hearths and gravel alleyways were recorded, which together formed a cluster of buildings in this unique environment between the Walbrook and Moorgate. Microstratigraphic analysis of deposits from one of these properties was also carried out, employing soil micromorphology, chemistry and magnetic susceptibility; this has enabled direct comparisons with Early Medieval occupation of the London Guildhall site and other urban archaeology studies across England.  These discoveries have been extremely important for several reasons. They provide evidence for early Roman activity by the banks of the Walbrook tributary in this area, with a valuable body of information recovered for the slightly lesser-known period from the end of the 2nd Century into the 3rd; some of the finds suggest trading links with northern England, possibly as a result of army activities; and important information has been gathered detailing the construction of Early Medieval buildings, survival of which in the archaeological record is rare.",

Two test pits were investigated in area 3 between 28 March and 16 April 1999.  Despite the presence of a major Roman burial ground just over! OOm to the southeast, there was no evidence of Roman inhumations or cremations on the site. There was some evidence of Roman occupation in the form of pits, a Roman well and occasional fragments of Roman pottery, but the area appears to have been relatively sparsely developed and may have remained open field or pasture until the Medieval period.  Evidence from the site suggests that by the fourteenth Century the land had been purchased for development. The first activity on the site appears to have been quarrying to extract gravel from the site. Large quarry pits were recorded in Areas 1 and 2. They appear to have been excavated systematically and backfilled rapidly with a relatively sterile 'topsoil'.  At least one building was constructed on the levelled site, possibly during the 14th-15th Centuries. The remains of this building consisted of chalk foundations and fragments ofa tile floor. An oven was also incorporated into the building. The tiles from the oven and floor were reused from an earlier building. Another large hearth and oven was constructed outside of the building.   During the 17th Century a new phase of buildings were constructed, also with large stone and chalk foundations. It is hoped that documentary research will be able to confirm the ownership and use of these buildings. Two unusual circular stone structures were associated with these properties. These do not appear to have been used for cess or any obvious industrial function.  At the eastern end of site a large brick lined cess pit was probably in use and backfilled during the 18th Century. The structure includes two brick bases, possibly for-supporting a vaulted roof. The brick lining faced an earlier chalk built foundation or lining.

The largest of these buildings was St Swithin's House on the north side of the current development area, where Ivor Noel Hume working for the Guildhall Museum undertook an extensive watching brief in 1949-50. Working in the shadow of the dragline excavators, which would ultimately remove all archaeology from this half of the site, Noel Hume and a small group of dedicated volunteers managed to record and excavate a large number of Roman, Medieval and Post Medieval buildings and features. Two trenches were also recorded independently by Professor W F Grimes, one in 1949 in the north courtyard of the former Salters' Hall Court beneath the east side of St Swithin's House, the other at the north end of Walbrook House during its construction in 1954. These antiquarian works form an important part of the history and story of the site not only in terms of their potential to enhance and expand on the recently excavated archaeological sequence, but also as a testament to the pioneering work carried out with incredibly limited resources by a small group of archaeologists 60 years ago which form the foundations of modern stratigraphic archaeological excavation in the City of London.   The recent excavation produced evidence of Prehistoric activity in the area of the site in the form of an extensive flint assemblage, one of the largest to be found in the City to date, which included later Mesolithic/Early Neolithic and Bronze Age flint. A well-preserved Roman sequence of 1st- early 2nd Century date was excavated, with the earliest features being 2 north/south 'V-cut' ditches, with the larger E ditch containing transitional late-Iron Age / early Roman pottery. These ditches are interpreted as having formed the W side of the defences around a military zone established soon after the Roman conquest in AD 43 and in essence demarcated the W side of the early City overlooking the east bank of the Walbrook.   There was intensive pre-Flavian (AD 50-70) activity on the site including quarries, pits, ditches and finds-rich levelling dumps, with the fills of one quarry and adjoining pit notable for a massive assemblage of fragmented ox bone, the waste product from a large-scale industrial process. After the Boudican revolt of AD 60/61 a north/south road was laid out over the early ditches to connect with an existing east/west road projected as crossing the south end of the site. Part of the secondary road its ditches and portions of clay and timber buildings along its edges were defined, and the existence of a piped water supply in the area of the site was indicated by two iron connecting collars from water pipes found in linear cuts along the west side of the road.    A well-preserved range of Flavian (AD 70-100) features found close to the Walbrook frontage included a variety of partially waterlogged structures with box-lined sumps, drains and structural wall timbers being defined. By the end of the 1st Century the buildings flanking the north/south road to the east had been replaced by more robust stone-founded buildings laid out along both sides of the road. The presence of two close-set parallel walls along the frontage suggests that there may have a colonnade or open portico along both sides of the road. To the west a new range of clay and timber buildings were erected, with many of the walls rendered with wall plaster which had then been painted. Found within one of the mudbrick  and timber-frame walls was a small ceramic unguent jar which had been deliberately placed as a 'foundation deposit' within the core of the wall and contained a variety of small personal items. All of these buildings were destroyed in the Hadrianic fire of AD120-130.   Evidence of later Roman activity had largely been removed by modern basements, with the exception of the north-east corner of a 2nd-3rd Century stone-founded building on the Walbrook frontage, and a series of domestic pits defined across the area of excavation. On the north side of the excavated area, the Roman levels were capped by 'Dark Earth' a deposit that has been found on numerous archaeological sites across the City, and is thought to have accumulated in the Centuries following the abandonment of the Roman City. Significantly, a large number of sherds from Camulodunum form 306 bowls were found in the Dark Earth together with multiple late 3rd - late 4th Century coins. The pottery is especially significant as it is thought to have ritual associations, and one of the largest concentrations to have been found locally was an assemblage from  a later use of the Temple of Mithras to the west of the site.   The Medieval and Post Medieval sequence was predominantly composed of external soil dumps and pits which included stone and brick-lined wells and cesspits - some containing large, diverse and impressive finds assemblages. Structural remains included the fragmentary walls and footings of a number of prestigious buildings known to have occupied the site from the Medieval period onwards, which were predominantly defined in the higher surviving area of archaeology beneath Oxford Court. Evidence for two important historical event horizons which devastated the City of London: the Great Fire of London in 1666 and the Blitz in 1940-41 were also defined in areas of the site.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate area of the site at a scale of 1:700 using OS MasterMap as a base.

A total of 10 trenches were excavated to assess the nature, date and significance of any archaeological remains present. The results of the field evaluation have helped to refine the initial assessment of the archaeological potential of the site mainly concerned with evidence for the 1890 to 1926 occupation of the site by buildings operated by Doulton's Lambeth Pottery.  Archaeological evidence for Doulton 's pattery was uncovered in Trenches 2, 3, 4 and 5. In Trench 4, was a 'the truncated base of a circular' kiln The east side af a similar kiln was recorded in Trench 2. Trench 3 cantained a series of three intercutting, successive, parallel-channelled flues. The nature of the product of the kilns was apparent after examination af the kiln shelves. These bare splashes of glaze (as did the kilns) and circular shadows, left after the removal of the product being fired. The shadows corresponded exactly with the size af stoneware bottles recovered from the site. The glaze seen as splashes was the same as that coating the bottles. Clearly Doulton were manufacturing their stoneware bottle at this site. Unfired clay was observed in Trenches 2, 3 and 5. First-hand evidence for the manufacturing pracess at Doulton 's Lambeth works is unique.  Beyond material relating to Doulton the evaluatian recorded truncated external sails - dating from before the build up of the site - some truncated, backfilled Victorian pits, one circular and lined with brick. At the west of the site, in Trench 10, was a stretch af the base of a linear, north-south, brick-built, 18th Century-type foundation, dating from the earliest, 18th Century, build up of the site.  *Natural gravels were recorded at a height of 2.25m OD*",

Test pit 5 initally overlay a backfilled brickwalled basement of 19th Century date. The basement was subdivided, beneath one, 17m down, just beneath a floor was a brick built culvert of yellow stock brick. The other side of the divide continued down 2.3m and continued below the JCB's full reach.  STP 1 This was located against the upstanding red-brick wall which bounded the open area to the south. This continued down to basement level, with its construction backfill on the north side, some 0.8m wide. It cut down through levelling deposits to 15.6m OD (2.1m below ground level). Below it was an undated layer of made ground, which was not bottomed, but was  over 300mm deep.  STP3 was located near the western end of car park, 6m to the west ofTP4. No walls of any period were observed. Directly below the concrete slab was a homogeneous deposit, 1.8m deep, of dark-grey with frequent fragments of brick and tile. This was different in character from the rubble backfill in TP5 and looked more like a large-scale dumping rather than a rubble basement backfill. Withinthe material on the west side of the test-pit was a north-south orientated shallow culvert, composed of red bricks bonded in soft cream-coloured mortar. The bricks were unfrogged and appeared to be 18th Century in date.  A group of test-pits within the standing building were excavated by contractors in the basement of Weddel House. They were dug to depths within the range 1.1m to 2.0m. All pits revealed nothing other than natural sands and gravels.

Small quantities of Late Bronze Age pottery was recovered from these fills. Quarry 1006 was a 11m x 7m x 3.5m deep. The upper part of the quarry contained a massive single deposit of mid-greyish orange brown sandy silt loam with occasional flint and moderate charcoal flecks. Two 13th Century and one Late Bronze Age pottery sherds were recovered from this occasional. The lower part of this quarry was not excavated (depth was calculated by hand-augering).",

The earliest feature on the site was a 26m long Roman ditch, partly with the 'ankle-breaking' profile suggestive of a military function. It had a fairly short life and was backfilled and levelled over at one time, with the first indications of several flimsy timber structures sealing the levelling. These structures, and a large domestic oven, were themselves sealed by a further levelling up for the first of the more substantial buildings. These buildings, Buildings 1 and 2, were single storey, with wattle and daub walls supported by clay sills and roofed with thatch, and were confined to the eastern half of the site. To the west was an extensive external gravel area, possibly a courtyard, which covered an area at least 17m x 16m. The two buildings were completely destroyed by a major fire, probably Boudican. The new buildings and streets were deliberately laid out on a new alignment, at 45 degrees to the preceding buildings, employing slightly different building techniques but producing basically timber, with wattle and daub walls and thatched roofs. Each was subdivided into several rooms and was altered internally during its lifetime. They formed in plan the shape of a fairly typical strip building and appeared to front onto the street running to the south and east. To the west of these buildings lay a street composed of bands of gravel heavily compacted to form a smooth surface with a slight camber in the middle. The sides were revetted with timber, and a succession of roadside ditches ran along both sides. The street was resurfaced at least three times and was in use well into the 2nd Century AD. This street must have met the street on which the buildings were fronting at an angle of less than 90 degrees, suggesting that the street found on the excavation may have been only a side street  Any later Roman activity that may have existed across the site was destroyed by a large number of 12th-Century and later rubbish pits, wells and three chalk-lined pits.",A GIS point was created at a scale of 1:2000 using OS MasterMap as a base.

The excavations revealed and investigated sections of the Roman wall and the associated ditch. The Roman wall, the face of which survived up to 2.45m in height, was associated with two successive ditches cut a short distance in front of it. The earlier, V-shaped in profile, was severely truncated by the later, flat-bottomed ditch. The backfill of the latter included debris which had tumbled from the wall. The berm in front of the wall was then reduced to the level to which most of the second ditch had been backfilled by the cutting of a third, more extensive flat-bottomed ditch which ran up to the face of the wall and initially exposed the upper courses of the foundations. The first deposits in this ditch were dated to the late 12th-13th Century and suggested that the wall was being reconstructed. Later dumps of relatively clean gravel may have been upcast from cutting a fourth, much deeper ditch further east, the earliest fill of which was dated to the 13th-mid-14th Century. The City wall, including its upper Medieval construction, survived to an overall height of nearly 11m. Its disuse as a defence was implied by the cutting of two successive pits in the backfill of the latest ditch. They were lined with horn cores, perhaps for an industrial purpose, and were constructed and backfilled in the late 17th Century. The wall then served as support for structures such as a furnace built in brick against its face. A cellar floor, other brick foundations and a brick-lined well were probably associated with the latest building on the site, known to have been built in 1767-70 as part of a redevelopment designed by George Dance the younger.",

During the Late Bronze Age a number of features were dug into the Pleistocene Terrace Gravels that formed the banks of the River Rom. On the western side of the river was large shallow oval feature. This was filled with a complex series of deposits, including flood deposits and some that were charcoal and artefact-rich with a high organic content. Interleaved between these was evidence for at least three in situ hearths. The feature had clearly been used for occupation but also appeared to have been periodically inundated by flooding from the adjacent river. Cutting through it were two pits that also showed evidence for in situ burning. Approximately 70m to the south was a mass of worked wood, including part of a wooden vessel and a number of cleft branches, poles and stakes. These did not appear to constitute a specific structure but represented an accumulation or dump of material left on the river's bank from woodworking activities. A shed red deer antler was found amongst them but its tines had broken in antiquity and it is uncertain if it was used as a tool. The large oval feature and the dump of wood were quickly sealed by thick deposits of alluvium, indicating increased rates of flooding shortly after this activity ceased.  On the eastern bank of the river, three evaluation trenches revealed a scatter of gullies and pits cut into the Terrace Gravels, some of which may have represented tree-throw hollows. These were also subsumed by alluvium. On both sides of the river a number of alluvial deposits attest periodic but increasing flooding and sedimentation throughout the remainder of the Prehistoric period and for most of the historic periods. During the late Medieval/early Post Medieval period two possible drainage ditches and a wood-lined pit were dug into the alluvium. These were followed by the formation of a soil horizon indicating dryer conditions. During the early Post Medieval period a large ditch of channel was constructed perpendicular to the western bank of the river, although its function remains enigmatic. During the early 20th Century the canalisation of the river allowed the area to be incorporated within the rapidly growing urbanization of this part of London.",GIS polygon mapped on OS Mastermap at 1:1250.

Alternating bands of black and white tesserae formed a narrow edge around the central panel, outside which larger squared red tesserae extended 1m to the walls of the room. The structure was destroyed by fire during the 2nd Century. Later Roman activity was represented by the northeast corner of a substantial but heavily robbed masonry structure, possibly dating to the 3rd Century and similar to those found at OST82. Overlying the Roman sequence, dark earth survived only in small pockets. The site was extensively pitted during the Medieval period and occupied from 1520, according to documentary sources, by Embroiderers' Hall (Schofield 1995). Near the Gutter Lane frontage, a single brick-lined cesspit, containing an assemblage of fine glass and pottery, appeared to be related to the hall.The rich finds are predominantly Roman and Post Medieval. The many Roman bone objects include a good selection of needles and pins, some complete, and, among less usual finds, a whole bone ligula, half a bone skate, a whole spindle-whorl and part of a double-sided ivory comb. Roman ceramics include many samian stamps, mortaria stamps, and several counters and lamps. Roman copper-alloy objects include a brooch, coins, and a lock and key. Roman glass includes flagons, jars and unguentaria. Among Post Medieval pottery are many whole vessels. Post Medieval pins, studs and rings were recovered, and Post Medieval glass comprised a range of forms, including many wine glasses, some with unusual decoration.",

Possible evidence of later Prehistoric activity was seen in a few minor features which survived extensive Roman truncation of the brickearth natural; worked flint flakes and a substantial amount of firecracked flint were recovered from the redeposited natural which covered the site.The initial Roman development of this area (Neronian/Flavian) was certainly planned as was evident in the continuous brickearth slab which was cut by hacking-out ditches; quarry pits were found in the east area of the site. Contemporary with this initial development was a major north to south Roman road 7.5m wide. Its projected alignment would appear to be close to that of the first forum, running north from the approximate centre of the forum to the west of the Roman forerunner of Bishopsgate, though it need not necessarily have been straight. Successive drains were excavated on either side of the road. Truncated post-holes from east to west aligned timber structures which fronted upon this road were found, as was also an early pit which contained much scorched daub with wattle impressions. These early structures were succeeded by more substantial, later 1st Century, brickearth buildings, which followed the earlier property lines. The interior surfaces of these later buildings survived in only a limited area where a baked clay hearth was found. A sequence of associated exterior surfaces in the east end of the site would suggest rebuilding of these structures.These buildings were destroyed or demolished probably in the early 2nd Century; a horizon of large fragments of painted wall plaster and a large pit containing substantial quantities of building materials, some of which was scorched, were found. These were sealed by a thick brickearth dump perhaps arising from a redevelopment of the area. During the watching brief, a small portion of an in situ red tessellated floor was seen in the SE corner of Crosby Square, and apparently dated from this redevelopment phase as it was bedded on similar brickearth deposits. In the east of the site a remarkable mid-2nd Century pit was excavated which produced over 100 kilos of pottery and a large quantity of building materials and household goods. Though no later Roman horizontal stratigraphy survived on the site, fills from truncated roadside drains indicate that the road may have continued in use during the 3rd Century. Only a few later Roman pits were present and their distribution would suggest that the early property boundaries had been maintained. One Late Saxon pit and a number of 12th-14th Century cesspits were excavated. Two standing late Medieval brick vaults, which had been part of the Crosby Place buildings (built c 1466) were examined and four main construction phases were recognised, dating from the 14th to the 17th Century. A large brick-vaulted cesspit was found within one of the vaults which were contemporary with their late commercial use.

The research indicates that there is a low potential for significant Prehistoric archaeology on the site. In the Roman period the area close to the north of the city wall was used as a burial ground c.100m south-east of the site. Later in the Roman period the Moorfields marsh began to form, possibly due to the Walbrook becoming partially blocked. The subsequent marsh deposited alluvium over the Roman land surface. The potential for significant Roman archaeology on the site is considered to be low given its location away from the burial grounds and beyond the city wall.  During the Medieval period the site occupied the now fully formed Moorfields marsh. Following attempts to drain the area it was used for pasture. In the 13th Century the manor house 'Finsbury Court' was built the main buildings lying north of the site. The site lay in the southern part of the manor precinct and was occupied by a garden with a small building adjacent to Finsbury Pavement.  In the 18th Century the site was developed. On its western side a Chapel was built, possibly with a burial ground and further north the site was occupied by a distillery. A major redevelopment of the site took place in 1950s and again in the 1970s. Most of the site has existing basements and in some areas double depth basements although the northwest corner of the site has no basement. Archaeological survival is generally considered to be poor. The buildings on the site are fully occupied, and no archaeological evaluation will be possible until vacant possession in 2019.   The proposed development will include a 3 storey and 1 storey basement which will remove all earlier deposits.

Natural fluvial sand was overlain by peat deposits dating from the Early and Middle Bronze Age, which were cut by two successive channels. The first of these was open in the late 17th Century, but may have had an earlier origin. It might perhaps have been a natural stream, rather than an artificially constructed drainage channel. The second channel probably originated in the late 17th Century, and continued in use through to the mid 18th Century. It was reinforced by two successive revetments, the second of which was mainly constructed from re-used timbers from 16th or 17th Century clinker built boats, such as Thames barges or lighters.

A series of land raising dumps sealed the channel silts in preparation for the construction of wooden lined tanning pits in the mid 18th Century or later. These were subsequently partially dismantled, and further make up dumps laid in advance of a second phase of tanning pits, dating to the late 19th Century.  *The natural alluvium was observed at -0.46m OD.*",

The site comprised the remaining quarter of a block which had produced evidence for London's early Roman waterfront in 1981 (PDN81 ELO4258). The area of excavation was about 20m x 15m and lay immediately adjacent to the expected alignment of the approach roads to both Roman and Medieval London Bridge.  In the early 1st Century, the sloping hillside leading down to the Thames was sealed by a series of dumped deposits to create an artificial level terrace upon which a substantial building was constructed. The west wall and the southwest corner of this building were masonry, but at least part of the south wall was probably timber framed. Internal brickearth surfaces in several large rooms and a corridor area along the western frontage were about 1m higher than the contemporary external ground level to the south. After a fire in the mid-1st Century, possibly associated with the Boudican revolt, the building was reconstructed to a similar plan but with timber walls replaced by masonry.  Later modifications occurred when the southwestern corner was rebuilt, the south wall was strengthened and a deep east-west foundation, possibly reflecting the roof ridge alignment, was built across the site. In its latest form, the building was about 14.5m wide east-west with a 7.2m gap separating the south wall and the central bisecting east-west foundation. To the west of the building a series of compacted gravel surfaces and a series of intercutting drains and gullies which led off to the south were found. The highest of these was backfilled with redeposited fire debris of the early-mid-2nd Century.  The later development of the site after this date is not known in detail, since the horizontal sequence was truncated by a modern concrete slab. However, many cut features were recorded.  Evidence of the two Late Saxon/Early Medieval cellared buildings was found, cut through the underlying Roman deposits. One used earth-fast posts regularly spaced around the edge of a rectangular cut; the other had north and east walls of mortared rubble and an east wall represented by a probable robbed timber sill. Inside both buildings was a series of brickearth and beaten-earth floors. A group of about 30 pits, ranging in date from mid-10th to early 13th Century, was found along the east side of the site. The particular concentration is presumed to reflect the close packing of properties along the Early Medieval predecessor of Fish Street Hill.  A complete 17th Century cellar, probably burnt in the Great Fire of 1666, was exposed, as well as a number of 17th-, 18th- and 19th Century wells, cesspits and wall foundations. These reveal the gradual evolution of the property boundaries which were extant until early 1985.",

Grimes returned to this site on a number of occasions, as he did to the site of Barber-Surgeons' Hall to the immediate north (WFG2), to examine further the complex sequence of Roman remains he discovered there. Before summarising these below, it should be pointed out that Medieval pit cutting had penetrated deep into natural soil across much of the site to the east of the city defences. In only a few places were natural and overlying Roman deposits seen. Even though they were poorly truncated, their significance was such that Grimes examined them as thoroughly as possible.  On the western side of the site, against the city defences, modern foundation stanchions had severely reduced the area available for study. Natural soil consisted of brickearth with no traces of pre-Roman activity. Immediately above, and underneath the bank of the fort, it was possible to discern horizontal layers similar to those at WFG2 which appear to represent pre-fort activity of an unspecified character. In the northwest part of the site, these had been cut by three rectangular pits which were lined with mortar. These mixing pits were backfills with the lowest dumps of material which made up the fort bank and so were probably employed for the mixing of mortar for use in the construction of the fort wall itself. The latter could not be seen owing to the presence of the city wall thickening and modern foundations.The fort bank consisted of redeposited brickearth with some mixed material. The latter contained a few finds, in particular coarse wares, broadly dated to the late 1st or early 2nd Century. A deposit low down in the fort bank, either predating the raising of the bank or one of its earliest dumped components, contained samian ware dating to the first two decades of the 2nd Century. This deposit, dated by Joanna Bird in the 1980s, replaces a single, worn coin of Vespasian, also from under or very low down in the bank, which Grimes had previously used as a terminus post quem.  As at WFG2, at the foot of the internal bank was a gully alongside a gravel, metalled surface with a slight camber. The gully had evidently been lined with wicker or horizontal planks: a great many stake-holes from vertically driven posts were found along either side of the gully. On the eastern side of the road, at the northern and southern ends of the site, short sections of ragstone wall were recorded aligned parallel with the line of the fort wall. At the southern end, gravel metallings ran across the projected line of this wall, suggesting a turn eastwards of the wall. Stake-holes in the natural may record the line of drainage gullies aligned east-west across this part of the site, but the gullies themselves had been backfilled with gravel and were not seen in plan. No floor levels or accompanying dating evidence is available for these features.  A straight-sided foundation trench was cut into the top of the fort bank. This made up the foundation of the city wall thickening which was built against the internal face of the fort wall. Dumps of mixed soil, truncated by Post Medieval features, suggest an additional bank contemporary with this city wall thickening. New road surfaces were laid but it is not certain if the Roman building on the east side of the fort road continued in use.   No trace was found of early, post-Roman occupation and the site appeared to have been clear of buildings until the late 13th or early 14th Century. Down to this time it was accumulating debris from the neighbouring areas, its level was gradually building up and in particular a number of deep square pits were dug for the disposal of rubbish. These were also seen in the northern part of the fort gate site to the immediate south (WFG5, ELO16161). They presented a very complicated appearance in the ground by reason of their number and the haphazard way in which they had been dug into one another. They varied in size, with the largest up to 6m deep. The pits produced considerable quantities of pottery as well as other debris which, unfortunately, no longer survive for study.  At the end of this pit-digging phase the area must have presented an irregular surface of not very savoury appearance, with a series of hollows whose soft fillings obviously provided a bad foundation for any building.The 14th Century builders of a large rectangular building were therefore obliged to sink very deep foundations, which they did in fact carry where necessary to the bottoms of even the deepest pits. Chalk was used throughout, the foundations being as a rule about 1.22m thick. Associated with the earlier building (which underwent various minor alterations) were two chalk-lined pits.  The building continued in existence until 1666 when it was destroyed by the Great Fire. The bases of its wall were levelled over with burnt debris and the small square chalk-lined pits of this period were filled in with burnt material which included a number of complete or near complete 17th Century pots.  This debris was sealed by the floor of a 19th Century building, but throughout the larger part of the 18th Century the area remained an open space with buildings around it, part of one such, dating to the late 18th-early 19th Century, remaining at the southwest corner of the site. This contained evidence of ironworking, suggesting the site of a smithy. The court appears as Westmoreland Court in contemporary plans, a name which links it with the Nevilles whose 'Inn' stood here in Medieval times; and there can be no reasonable doubt that the building, part of whose plan was recovered on this site, was Neville's Inn, of which a certain amount of information is recorded by Stow and others.",

Excavations were carried out in the single basements of standing buildings at 1-4 Giltspur Street and 18 Cock Lane. After demolition of these buildings further excavation took place both there and in an unbasemented area to the north and west, next to 24-30 West Smithfield from September to December 1989, followed by a watching brief.  Natural sand and gravels were cut by pits, one of which contained Late Bronze Age pottery. The Late Bronze Age pottery is a substantial bucket urn of post-Deverel-Rimbury type. It is unusual to find a complete vessel of this kind in the City.  In the early Roman period pits were dug to quarry gravel. These were then backfilled with rubbish or left to silt up. Later the site was partly levelled up with brickearth, pits were dug and hearths were used, perhaps for an industrial purpose. These features were truncated by a series of at least 127 burials, forming part of an extensive late Roman cemetery. These burials, including 14 chalk burials, were aligned variously, but generally north-south or east-west. The density of burials was variably localised, some phases of graves coinciding with pits and rubbish disposal and one small area remaining free both of graves and pits. One of the Roman burials, of a child, contained ten bracelets of shale, copper and bone, as well as a silver earring and a glass bead necklace. Another grave contained five copper-alloy bracelets, a silver earring and an intact Nene Valley ware colour-coated beaker.

Two burials were accompanied by decorated bone combs, one of which is a rare form: a double-sided comb made of composite materials, dated to the 4th Century. One of these combs was situated behind the skull and was presumably a hair comb in situ. A copper-alloy ring was found on the finger of another skeleton.

No Prehistoric features were observed. Although a small amount of worked and burnt flint was found in later features these are more likely to originally have been associated with a postulated settlement further east.  It should be noted that the original nature and extent of surviving deposits have been seriously disturbed by subsequent truncation by later features. The earlier the deposit, the more likely that this has been lost. The exception to this seems to be the postMedieval material. As the area is known to have been heavily built-up in this period, only the very deep features survived truncation by the late 19th and early 20th Century basements.  The earliest evidence for Roman occupation was a small fragment of a clay-and-timber building along the southern limit of the site dated to AD 60-70. Flavian expansion in the last three decades of the 1st Century AD saw a moderate increase in the number of clay-and-timber buildings. These were associated with a gravelled road that connected the area to the main road network to the south. A fire destroyed these buildings, at least partially, in the early years of the following Century. This is possible evidence for the Hadrianic fire that swept through and destroyed much of Londinium between AD 120-130.  The period AD 120-1 60 saw the construction and occupation of masonry buildings of relatively high status. In the northern area of the site large quarries for the extractionof gravel and brickearth point to an increase in building activity, both in the immediate vicinity and elsewhere in the City. The large number of Roman artefacts testifies to the level of activity on the site during this period.  Evidence for activity during the later years of the Roman occupation is in the form of a very large masonry building that covered much of the area excavated. Roman masonry observed during sewerage works beneath Threadneedle Street in 1849 is likely to be part of the same structure. Pitting that is probably contemporary with the building indicates occupation in the late 3rd14th Century AD.  The domestic nature of the material produced by the deposits indicates that the nature of the occupation throughout the entire Roman period is residential. The site was subsequently abandoned for some time, with no activity evident until the Early Medieval period.  From the mid- l l th Century to the end of the 12th Century the site became active once again. No evidence for structures were recorded and all indications are that this was an area of open ground and was utilised for the disposal of domestic rubbish, usually in specifically dug pits. Pitting continued into the later Medieval period as well as some structural elements, some of which may be of an industrial nature. Two large masonry walls were revealed beneath Adams Court in the northern area, one of which gives a likely indication of Medieval ground level.  The only Post Medieval features that survived were several brick-lined cesspits and rubbish pits.  *The highest level of surviving natural brickearth was recorded at 12.09m OD, though this is likely to have been truncated, even if only slightly, by initial clearance of the site in the early Roman period.

The earliest features on site were the truncated pits and portions of the ditches of a Norman-period (1050/1200) fortress (perhaps Montfichet's Tower). Two phases of ditch aligned broadly east/west were located along the north side of Carter Lane. Both ditches terminated along the line of Cobb's Court alley at the west side of the site, approximately on the line of the north/south Roman and Norman city wall. The earliest south ditch did not extend right across the site; it was over 7m long, some 5m wide and 1.2m deep. The terminal at its east end may mark the position of an entrance into the fortress. The later south ditch (which presumably destroyed the rest of the earliest ditch), represents a realignment and widening of the defences. It was 16m wide and over 4m deep. This ditch has now been traced for 41m to the east along Carter Lane. The lowest excavated fills date to 1050-1200.The north ditch was aligned east/west, parallel to the Ludgate Hill street frontage. The ditch was 6.8m wide, 2.8m deep and at least 11.5m long; the west extent of the ditch is unknown, but it did not reach the city wall-line as it was not found during salvage recording at 37 Ludgate Hill (GM251). The dating evidence for these ditches was limited as only the later south ditch produced Norman material; the others produced only Roman finds.  The great quantity of Roman material probably derived from the reduction of the earth bank behind the city wall. Within the area between the two sets of ditches (the bailey) were a number of cess- and rubbish pits cut into natural gravel and brickearth. Some of these pits contained Norman material, but many contained only Roman finds. This fortress was probably a motte and bailey complex on Ludgate Hill inside the city walls. The fortress was defended by ditches on three sides approximately in line with modern streets (north, Ludgate Hill; east, probably Creed Lane; south, Carter Lane) and with the city wall on the fourth side. The existence of a motte, towards the esat side of the fortress, can be postulated from the volume of material the excavation of the ditches would have produced.It is documented that the fortress was in ruins by 1272, and in either 1274 or 1276 the Dominicans acquired it as a stone quarry to provide materials to help build their new friary nearby. The later south ditch was systematically infilled (dated by pottery to 1150-1350), then used as part of the friary cemetery. Sixty articulated inhumations were excavated on the present site, thirteen of which were in a mass grave, two in a double grave and the rest were single burials. Twenty-five had evidence of wooden coffins; there was also one lead coffin. There were five possible empty or unused graves. The overall plan of the graves showed a regular layout. Finds from the grave fills indicate a 13th- or 14th Century date; two graves may be as late as c 1500. After the Dissolution, a rectangular chalk-walled cellar (internal dimensions 3.1m x 2.4m) was built during the late 16th Century. The cellar was used as a lead-smelting or casting workshop. It was damaged by fire during the mid-17th Century and a brick paved floor and stairs were added. The cellar was then used as a coal store and became a rubbish dump during the 18th Century. Contemporary with the later use of the cellar were a number of brick-lined cesspits of 17th- and 18th Century date. Almost all traces of the associated buildings were destroyed by Victorian basements. The major exception to this destruction was an area of standing masonry (party wall between 54/56 Carter Lane and 1/3 and 6 Ludgate Square) which was surveyed. The earliest masonry was ragstone rubble containing a number of Medieval moulded stones; above this was a large area of late 17th/18th Century brickwork, containing no architectural features except part of a chimney flue.  No Roman features were identified on this site and the Roman finds, which include a copper-alloy belt, a shale bowl and two brooches, were residual within later deposits. Several of the Medieval burials were accompanied by gravegoods, in the form of belt-fittings, pins, a spindle-whorl and a prunted glass beaker. Quantities of later Medieval moulded stones were retrieved from Post Medieval contexts, which included also a glass vessel, wig-curlers and an axe.",

The archaeological investigations encountered the uppermost archaeological horizon at c. 3.30m OD and demonstrated the presence of a stratified archaeological sequence measuring 1.87m thick along the western side of the site.  The archaeological sequence comprised timber buildings, possibly of high status, that were destroyed by fire, probably around the time of the Boudican revolt of AD 60-1. Several subsequent phases of building were aligned along a hitherto unrecognised north-south thoroughfare, and included evidence for smithing in the late 1st Century AD. A period of rebuilding, possibly during the mid-2nd Century AD, included substantial masonry buildings on piled foundations, one probably adorned with marble floors and stone columns, indicative of high status.  The Medieval period was represented mostly by pits dating from the 12th Century, the latest of which produced high status pottery and possible evidence for the presence of an apothecary in the area during the early-mid 16th Century.

In addition three bridges were recorded prior to their removal or alteration as part of the 2012 Olympic Redevelopment. The Eastern Counties Railway from London to Romford was constructed between 1836 and 1839, to designs by the ECR's chief engineer, John Braithwaite. In contrast to London's East End, where a brick viaduct was constructed at considerable expense to carry the railway above crowded streets, the railway was carried across the Lea valley on an embankment, raising it above the flood-prone marshes. A number of bridges were incorporated into the embankment, and a short viaduct was constructed to carry the railway between Pudding Mill Lane and Marshgate Lane. The Eastern Counties Railway amalgamated with a number of smaller railway companies in 1862, forming the Great Eastern Railway. The railway embankments, viaduct and bridges over the River Lea, City Mill River, Waterworks River, Warton Road and Carpenter's Road were successively widened in order to meet the increase in railway traffic that occurred throughout the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. The expansion of the railway network across the Lea Valley attracted businesses which had formerly been based in the centre of London to the area, settling previously undeveloped parts of the Lea and allowing businesses to expand. The Railways Act of 1921 created the 'Big Four' railway companies, and the Great Eastern Railway became part of the London and North Eastern railway Company in 1923.

An evaluation was carried out by the Trust in 1995, which recovered evidence for Late Bronze Age structures and a placed deposit of pottery in a pit. As a result some 2.5 ha in the south-central part of the site became the focus of the 1996 excavation. The site is particularly significant because of the association of a circular ditched enclosure or ringwork with contemporary field system, as well as clusters of enclosed and unenclosed circular structures. Two enclosures were formed by rings of pits or large post-holes. Placed pottery deposits and unurned cremations were found, mostly associated with structures and entranceways.

Aitchison and completed by R.A. Roumieu. It belonged to the Crosse & Blackwell Company who produced pickles and sauces in a factory in Soho Square. The building was once linked by a walkway over the street to the Astoria to the north, itself formerly a warehouse and part of the food factory. The building's appearance had been much altered; the original gothic arched loops and windows were replaced and the whole facade onto Charing Cross Road was re-rendered, although the proportions of the original facade remained, as did a turret with a spire in the north-east corner of the building. Crosse and Blackwell left the Soho area in the 1920s and the warehouse was converted to showrooms and offices in 1925; it formerly extended further to the south-west. A building fronting Charing Cross Road was built as a dance school in 1905, with retail units on the ground floor and the third building was built on the site of the demolished portion of the Crosse & Blackwell warehouse complex.

The results have shown a sequence of gravels overlain by fluvial sand and sandy clay deposits possibly within a channel. Above this was a 1m thick deposit of peat representing possible infilling of the channel followed by a 1.5m thick deposit of silty clay alluvium including a possible floodplain soil formation.

Seven periods of Roman occupation were recorded. In Periods I and II (both pre-Neronian), two distinct structures were evidenced by slots and post-holes. One of these did not align with the north to south gravelled Roman street found in the east of the site, and both structures are thought to predate its setting-out. In Period III (Flavian) at least two buildings, one of which included concrete floors and a tessellated pavement, fronted onto the street, and were bounded by an open area to the south and west. In Period IV (Trajanic), these were replaced by a structure interpreted as a lean-to against a larger structure off site to the west, and the area adjacent to the street on the east now became external. The suggested lean-to was replaced in Period V (c 120-5) by another light structure which was destroyed in the Hadrianic fire. In Period VI (c 125-30), slots of a massive building cut into the fire debris may represent temporary reuse of the area, before extensive rebuilding in Period VII (mid-2nd Century). The back of a timber building including a tessellated floor lay in the west of the site, and was bounded on the east by a gravelled yard. A well was sunk to the north of the building. The building was dismantled by the end of the Antonine period, and the site was covered with dark earth (Period X). The street probably remained in use beyond the 2nd Century, although its later surfaces were less well laid. In Period VIII (10th Century) a sunken-floored structure was cut through the west side of the Roman street, with an entrance porch actually on the street itself, suggesting that the latter survived in some form, if only as a rough track. The structure became filled with rubbish, but was later cleared out and reoccupied before its final disuse. In Period IX (?10th Century) a second sunken-floored structure cut a corner of the first and lay on top of the Roman street. Both sunken-floored structures were truncated, but they presumably lay in or above the dark earth horizon. Above the dark earth were traces of a light timber structure (Period XI, 10th Century), along the Milk Street frontage, and a large number of Medieval pits (Period XII, late 9th-12th Century), some with plank or wattle linings. In Period XIII (12th-15th Century) stone buildings were constructed along the Milk Street frontage.

Natural gravel was recorded outside 22-24 Bishopsgate beneath a wall and compacted rubble fill of red unfrogged bricks. This was sealed by modern rubble and backfill beneath the pavement slab. A borehole on the south side of Great St Helens indicated that a pit had cut into the natural brickearth and was sealed by a dumped deposit dated to the mid-1st to mid-2nd Century. Above was a series of Roman occupation deposits, the top showing evidence of fire debris and burnt brickearth floors. These were sealed by disturbed deposits and modern infill.  A Roman opus signinum floor was recorded cut by fourteen Medieval grave cuts relating to the cemetery of St Helen Bishopsgate, beneath modern material. An excavation at 4 Crosby Square revealed natural brickearth sealed by Roman dumped deposits above which was a series of clay-and-timber buildings, the earliest dating to the 1st Century AD. Along the east limit of the area, a mud brick wall was found with white wall plaster and a plain white fine tessellated border. In the north-west corner of this area, cutting the clay-and-timber building, was a sunken plunge pool constructed from brick with a thick opus signinum floor and rendering on the internal faces. These features were cut by pits of late Roman or Medieval date beneath a dumped soil horizon. A trench on the east side of Crosby Square revealed natural brickearth beneath the fragmented remains of Roman clay-and-timber buildings. These had been cut by a series of late Roman or Medieval pits which were sealed by yard surfaces and walls of late Medieval date, the latter possibly associated with the nearby 15th Century Crosby Hall. Walls of 17th-18th Century date were also found. The removal of the Hall to Chelsea in 1908 had truncated later deposits.   A small excavation undertaken on a sewer drop shaft at the junction of Great St Helens and Crosby Square revealed natural brickearth sealed by a thick Roman dumped deposit. Over this was a north to south aligned Roman internal wall with opus signinium floors on either side which appeared to have been destroyed in a fire and the foundation robbed, leaving only part of the eastern plaster face remaining. Demolition material sealed the remains of the building and over this was a later Roman opus signinium floor, probably the same floor found in the gantry trench immediately to the east. Four inhumations and cemetery soil associated with Medieval St Helen Bishopsgate were cut into and over this floor.   Natural brickearth was cut by probable quarries and a possible grave cut. The quarries were sealed in the east and south by fragmented remains of Roman clay and timber buildings, one of which had a plain red tessellated floor, and in the north-east corner of the site by the robbed foundations of a Roman masonry building. At least two rooms associated with this building were found, all with brickearth floors. A Roman masonry drain cut east to west across the building, a wider return to a north to south aligned drain made from re-used roof tiles recorded in the north-west of the site. The buildings were sealed by thick dumps of re-deposited brickearth containing painted wall plaster fragments and cut by a sequence of Roman and Medieval pitting, overlain by soil layers and yard surfaces.

The excavation of TP11 and TP16 towards the northern end of the basement produced further  vidence of survival of archaeological deposits and structures in this area. Excavation of TP16 located 3.9m depth of surviving stratigraphy including remains of what may be a Medieval well. This trial pit confirmed survival of archaeological deposits to a depth of lower than c. 8.00m OD. Another deep well or cesspit was previously identified during the first phase of ground investigations in TP8 to the east of TP16. Stratigraphy in this corner of the site would appear to be deeper than to the northwest of the site. Evidence from TP13 was inconclusive, but the brick rubble footing in this location is unlikely to be of any considerable depth and it is anticipated that archaeological deposits will survive beneath it. The location of a Medieval chalk wall and horizontal stratigraphy to a depth of 1m in TP11, reiterated evidence that deposits and features survive in this area of the site.  The site investigations have again suggested that any construction either side of the area of the sub-basement at the northern end of the site has the potential to remove and destroy archaeological deposits and structures. The survival of fill deposits to at least 8.00m OD in TP16 may indicate the possibility of some truncated survival of deposits at the north end of the car park where the basement slab is at 10.6-10.7m OD.  Evidence from TP12 suggested that foundations for the northern sub-basement are likely to be of sufficient depth to have probably removed all archaeological deposits in this area of the site. Similarly evidence from TPs and cores in the southern part of the sub-basement suggests the apparent existence of a basement slab of around 1.5m thickness is likely to preclude any archaeological survival in this area.  The excavation of TP1 suggested footings and the lower basement slab in this area of the site have probably removed all archaeological deposits in the south western area of the site.  *Natural gravel was observed in TP11 at 9.98m OD this is much the same as in TP10 where natural gravel was observed at 9.92m OD.*",

This study, commissioned as a response to perceived difficulties in the evaluation of the alluvial sequences within the Thames/ Medway corridor of the CTRL, was necessary due to the limitations of the previous assessment of the historical and cultural resources of this area produced by OAU. The aims of the project were firstly to examine the evaluation strategies commonly used within areas containing deeply stratified alluvium. Secondly to examine the likely relationship between archaeological sites and sedimentary contexts within such areas. Thirdly to examine the likely nature of the stratigraphy within alluvial areas of the CTRL and fourthly to examine data from individual route windows in order to determine the sub-surface nature of the sedimentary record in the CTRL vicinity. The objectives of the study were to: 1. Provide a stratigraphic framework for the alluvial route corridor of the CTRL and 2. Attempt to define areas of geoarchaeological interest within individual route windows. To achieve this a selection of representative boreholes were taken and used to construct the route corridors stratigraphy. Typically 20 representative boreholes were selected per route window and the stratigraphy of each borehole was plotted and lithostratigraphic correlations made between adjacent boreholes. From this the route corridor was subdivided into geoarchaeological zones based on the trend of the topographic template, the proximity or the route area to the edge of the alluvium, the nature of the sedimentary stack and dissimilarities in lithologic continuity across space. A number of conclusions made, including that the nature of the sediment sequences along the route corridor shows considerable variation, that the time depth of sequences varies considerably along the route corridor length and 27 geoarchaeological zones were recognised in the Thames corridor, 3 zones within the Ebbsfleet valley area and 5 zones in the Medway Crossing region.

The site comprised three trenches targeting Post Medieval features and a area excavation of the Roman and earlier features. The site covered over 1.25ha, making it one of the biggest excavations in Roman Southwark.  Prehistoric remains were limited to Bronze Age peats with possible ard marks, indicating agriculture.  Additionally, residual Iron Age pottery was found in later fill.  The earliest Roman features indicated the presence of structures and evidence for water management. Between AD70-120 ditches were dug to divide the land  and the most northerly was turned into a road.  The road was not at a 90 degree angle to Watling Street, meaning that a grid layout for Southwark was unlikely.  To the north and west of the ditches further clay and timber buildings were constructed, some possibly with second storeys.   Features constructed during the mid-2nd Century included an 80m ditch which appears to run the course of a natural stream.  In this ditch, complete finds were discovered, leading to the conclusion that they were ritually deposited.  This ritual deposition may have led to the later religious complex being constructed.  Additionally, a number of post holes in a radial concentration may indicate some type of theatre.    In the late 2nd Century AD all the buildings were removed and a religious complex was constructed. This comprised two Roman-Celtic temples with an eastern boundary ditch.  This complex also had gravel surfaces and mosaics.  Additionally, plinths and alters were found.    The site underwent further changes in the 3rd and fourth Centuries. The northwest/southeast aligned buildings were demolished and a wall was constructed around part of the temple complex, enclosing it. A 22m long building was constructed during this time, which had a timber lined cellar. Some of the previous walls are robbed for a makeshift structure, which may date to the early post Roman period.   During the Medieval period most of the site was used for agriculture. There was a network of ditches dividing the land, the largest of this being 40m in length.  Other ditches fed into this main ditch, dividing the land into strips of land 5-6m wide. Additionally, evidence for quarrying and a possible agricultural structure were found.  By the 15th-17th Centuries, the land appears to have been developed.

The earliest deposits comprised a stream-bed, one of the channels of the upper Walbrook, seen as a naturally eroded surface of sands and gravels occupying a shallow, broad channel running northeast-southwest across the site. Within this main channel were series of smaller stream channels interspersed with washouts of pea gravel and fine waterlaid silts. Brickearth and clay dumping during the Roman period was recorded on the east and west banks of the stream. Marsh and peat deposits up to 1.3m were found within the Walbrook Valley, indicating part of the large marsh which accumulated in the area from the late Roman to the Medieval period (later known as Moorfields). A large 13th-14th Century linear feature aligned north-south, probably a ditch, corresponds with a ditch shown on the Copperplate map (c.1558) and one previously recorded nearer the City wall to the south.  Wooden revetments running east-west were recorded near the assumed line of the precinct of St Mary Bethlem Hospital.  Excavations in the southwest corner of the site were completed in April 1986, revealing considerable dumping over the marsh deposits.  A section was cut through the east bank of the Walbrook. The bank in this part of the site was constructed of compacted gravel, clay and building rubble. Tentative dating evidence from ceramic material places its construction to 180-230. Some 400 Post Medieval burials were excavated from an area within the boundaries of the new churchyard, founded in 1569 by the City to relieve the congestion occurring in parish burial grounds. The burials were found in high density, some eight per cubic m. The cemetery was used up to at least 1720. Primary burials were mostly uncoffined but a large proportion of the later inhumations were coffined burials. A large brick vault contained six members of the Jenkes family, in lead coffins with highly decorated wooden inner coffins, dating from 1686 to 1714.

All trenches and pits had a sub-surface layer of between 0.5m and 1m deep of a dark ashy layer occastionally mixed with Post Medieval/modern rubble. The ash may have filled Post Medieval quarries but the top of burial and significant quantities of disarticulated human bone exposed limited the depth of investigations. The burial are thought to have been dug into the ashy dump and some of the pottery may be residual and be incorporated during burial. The Post Medieval assemblage included a redware large jug handle (1580-1900) and locally made tinware plate or bowl fragment with a Chinese-style decoration (late 1700's, Lucy Whittingham pers. comm.). A clay tobacco pipe fragment is consistent with type ""25"" of the Department of Urban Archaeology series (1700-1770, Groves 1984, 2 Department of Urban Archaeology Tobacco Pipe Series).  The human remains represented a minimum of four adults (including three males and one unsexed individual) and one infant. Although no articulated remains were visible it appeared that the depth at which excavation ceased represents the top of formal burials (commonly only 2-3 feet below the ground surface in Post Medieval cemeteries and currently stipulated by the Local Authorities Cemetery Order of 1977), whilst above this large quantities of disarticulated bone are present.  *Natural deposits were not observed*",

The surface of the sand was recorded at a maximum height of + 100.34m PD along the western end of the excavation trench and +100.28m PD along the eastern end. This small difference in height was probably caused by the former presence of a channel aligned approximately west-east across the vent shaft area.

Recording was carried out in response to a planning condition for the redevelopment of the site and the demolition or partial demolition (facade retention) of the existing buildings.  Documentary research and building recording established that although the building at no. 1 Valentine Place was demolished in 2010, two date plaques with the date '1886' and initials of Charles Joseph Percival still survive at the south-west and south-east corners of the plot.  Percival operated as a 'provisions merchant and general contractor' from no. 1 Valentine Place in the late 19th Century.

Following the earlier evaluaiton an excavation of of the column foundation in Trench 1 was carried out and a watching brief was maintained on the enlarging of Trench 5 (tree pit 4).  A small assemblage of residual struck flints was recovered from site. These consisted of brown flint blades and narrow flakes, most of which were used as piercers, of probable Mesolithic or early Neolithic date and black flint flakes of possible later Neolithic or Bronze Age date. The black flints may, however, represent Medieval and later dressed building cobble and waste products. The earlier assemblage certainly suggests a Prehistoric presence on the north bank of the Thames.  Dumping of 11th/12th Century date was revealed in Trenches 1 & 2, which may represent the backfilling of large sand and gravel quarry pits dug during the construction of the New Temple. A north-south aligned ragstone wall with associated mortar floors of Medieval date were revealed in Trench 5 to-the east of the courtyard. This probably represents the eastern part of the cloisters.

An evaluation was undertaken in 49 trial pits and two geoarchaeological cores. Natural alluvial deposits were found throughout the site except in one trial pit immediately to the east of Bermondsey Street where natural sand was overlain by tidal mudflat alluvium. The earliest features uncovered were two phases of timber revetments in a trial pit W of Weston Street. The first consisted of an E-W aligned oak base-plate with a mortise slot (possibly a re-used ship's timber) of possible 14th-15th Century date. This was sealed by a deposit of undated alluvium into which timber piles of varying sizes had been driven with one interlinking plank. Chalk had been used as consolidation/packing behind this later structure. The alluvium was cut by curved intercutting walls dated 1500-1600 which may have originally formed either a grand domestic dwelling or an industrial structure. A trial pit E of Bermondsey Street revealed re-deposited alluvium containing Medieval pottery of 1340-1450. The alluvium was sealed by dumping and demolition layers of possible 15th-16th Century date. Evidence for activity in the period c.1650-1800 was recorded across the site, consisting of dumps of household waste, garden walls, cellar floors, and corresponding soil horizons. Substantial dumps of clinker waste were mainly located in the S area of the site. A trial pit on the E side of Bermondsey Street revealed evidence of the densely packed domestic buildings shown on Ogilby & Morgan's map of 1676, where multiple phases of masonry walls running parallel to the street point to its alteration, perhaps due to 18th Century street widening. The majority of structures recorded were walls which due to their robustness were probably the remains of industrial premises that, along with densely-packed tenements, occupied the area as shown on Horwood's map of 1799. Late 18th- and early 19th Century cobbled streets and associated culverts were particularly common to the W of Stainer Street and represent the latest occupation prior to the first phase of station construction in 1836. The archaeological remains were sealed by 19th-20th Century cobbled surfaces beneath modern concrete.",

This site is also sometimes called Temple House. The present building on the site (1997) is called Temple Court. A line of squared wooden piles was observed running just north of Budge Row, roughly in line with Watling Street, but as these probably formed part of a complex of posts their alignment may not signify much. Patches of clean ballast were seen where the grab had been working along the line of Budge Row, overlying a thin layer of black pebbly mud, from which an amphora handle was recovered.

However, all three are part of a series of excavations undertaken by the Department of Greater London Archaeology (Southwark & Lambeth) in 1983 within the site of the Medieval palace of the bishops of Winchester. These excavations revealed early Roman quarry pits partly filled with waterlaid clay, suggesting continuous inundation of the area in the mid-1st Century ad. The Roman sequence in the E part of the site included clay and timber buildings aligned NW-SE and consisting of at least two phases of later 1st Century date. In the late 1st-early 2nd Century a N-S timber fence was erected across the line of one of the now demolished clay and timber buildings; to the W was a gravel path and an apsidal-ended building, and to the E the line of the fence was continued to the N by the W wall of a building with an internal mortar floor and a circular tile hearth built into its clay S wall. The fence and structures to the E and W had been demolished by the mid-2nd Century, and tips of ironworking waste were over the area. The latest Roman structure discovered had reverted to the NW-SE alignment. Remains of a single masonry building complex, extending across the area of excavation, suggested a substantial riverfront property. To the SW of the building five rooms were identified, three with hypocaust systems of which one had been provided with a mosaic floor and wall frescoes. Alterations in the building layout fell into perhaps four major structural phases and would suggest a fairly lengthy period of use, probably from the late 2nd Century to the second half of the 4th. Evidence of Late Saxon-Medieval occupation was limited by truncation, but several deep pits and dark earth dumps could be dated to the 10th-11th Century. The remains of Winchester Palace at the W end of the site comprised three principal phases of chalk and ragstone wall foundations defining the SE corner of the 13th-14th Century courtyard ranges, fronting onto the Great Hall of the palace. The third building phase involved considerable modification of the S end of the E range in the 14th Century for the insertion of a garderobe pit, which continued in use until the 17th Century. The Medieval courtyard buildings probably continued in use into the 19th Century; a brick-lined cellar was constructed at the S end of the E range in the 18th Century, and at about this time cellared buildings encroached upon the courtyard and the N part of the garderobe area.",GIS polygon created 09/05/2012 at 1:1250 using OS mastermap.

There was also evidence of quarrying of the brickearth and gravel. Previous excavations and documentary sources have already identified this area as the site of a Roman cemetery. A number of other Roman pits and postholes  were also excavated; one pit containing a substantial quantity of painted Roman wall plaster.

There is little evidence for the Palaeolithic to the Middle Bronze Age.   Evidence for Late Bronze age settlement and field systems comes from the river terraces.  The area contains a number of hillforts and defended settlements of Iron Age date and there are indications of Roman settlement across the Thames Chase area.  There is little evidence for the Saxon period, but documentary and place name evidence suggests that settlements were located along the edge of the gravel terraces in this period.  The pattern of Medieval settlement is mainly: along the edge of the gravel terraces at the junction with the alluvium, at the junction with the clay; and along the outcrop of the Claygate Beds.  Many of the recorded Medieval sites are moated houses.  The Post Medieval period saw large scale drainage schemes and mechanisation of agriculture.  By the early 19th Century the main areas of common land were in less fertile areas and the gravel terraces were mainly enclosed.

This phase of investigation revised and corrected a number of interpretations made during the preceding evaluation (ELO16771), chiefly surrounding.  The excavation covered the eastern end of the church and the Prior's lodgings, set within an area of garden.  The earliest feature identified was an unlined well of 12th Century date and several gravel pits. Parts of the Dominican priory of Blackfriars, established c 1276, were known to have occupied the site. To the north, these included the east end of the choir of the priory church, but little of the walls of the choir remained as they appear to have been replaced by existing basement walls on the north and east edges of the site. Inside the choir, five burials and two brick burial vaults were found, the latter emptied and then used for rubbish disposal some time after the dissolution of the priory in 1538. To the south, the prior's lodging and a garden are documented. These were represented by stone foundations and an external garderobe pit, the former surrounding a floor of delftware tiles and last used as a coal cellar before demolition in the late 17th or 18th Century. The party wall along the southern edge of the site incorporated stone foundations of the external wall of an undercroft (recorded further to the south in 1900, located below the provincial's hall and the S dorter). These foundations were buttressed to the north; to the west upstanding masonry contained a large window of c 14th Century date, subsequently blocked, which will be preserved and displayed in the new development. Along the west edge of the site, to the south, another substantial Medieval foundation was recorded: probably the east wall of the chapter house. Most of the finds are Post Medieval in date.

Over the winter of 1981-2 the Department of Urban Archaeology carried out work on two sites in Lovat Lane: a small excavation at 22 Lovat Lane, and standing masonry was photogrammetrically recorded at 9 Lovat Lane. At the first site, no horizontal stratigraphy survived beneath the cellar slabs; only the truncated bottoms of half a dozen pits cut into the natural gravel. The pits dated from the 11th to the 18th Century and the latest, a rectangular brick and tile lined cesspit, produced an interesting group of artefacts. Examination of the standing walls around the site demonstrated that the chalk, rag and brick walls claimed by Marjorie Honeybourne to be those of the late 12th Century Inn of the abbot of Waltham were in fact later, either Post Medieval or post-Fire rebuilds.  At 9 Lovat Lane the stripping of the rendering and tiling from the basement walls of no. 9 1/2 showed that it concealed a well-preserved chalk undercroft lining measuring 10m x 4.5m. The squared chalk blocks were accurately laid with very narrow mortar gaps. The lining survived to street level at the east end fronting onto Lovat Lane, and was pierced by two blocked openings, interpreted as a central entrance and a window. The rear, west end wall survived even higher with the remains of a spiral staircase in the northwest corner squared-off by later modifications. It was built using a combination of materials: chalk for the spiralling barrel vault and containing wall, the latter with a brick facing. The door jamb of the entrance into the staircase was in Reigate stone and the treads of the surviving steps in hard Kentish rag. Alongside the entrance a recess had been cut into the west wall of the undercroft to house the door flush when it was swung right back.The vault was replaced with a joist floor and the floor raised (by almost 1m) in 1620, and the basement was finally tiled over and used as a tank for live eels when the premises above were converted for the production of jellied eel. No dating evidence was recovered in association with the undercroft, and the only indications of its date of construction are stylistic.

Three of the trenches (those to the rear of the property - away from the Whitechapel Street frontage) exposed deep quarry pits backfilled at the end of the 15th or beginning of the 16th Centuries. The final backfill possibly contained German Stoneware, which puts them at a similar date to quarries on WCE01 and may be related to rebuilding of the city defences in 1477. They had removed brickearth deposits along with any potential Roman burials and were dug into the underlying natural Terrace Gravels. They were overlain with 18th Century landfill deposits of ash and nightsoil, which were in turn cut through by cellars of the 18th, 19th and 20th Centuries.   A trench on the Whitechapel Street frontage had small isolated and truncated fragments of natural brickearth surviving beneath an 18th Century cellar.  No Roman burials were excavated.

An 11-month excavation of Areas A, B and C on the west side of Pudding Lane, a five-month excavation of Area F on the east side of Fish Street Hill and a subsequent watching brief produced evidence of natural topography and the line of the north bank of the pre-Roman River Thames.  A Roman-piled embankment, timber landing-stage, and late 1st Century timber quay surviving to its full height, associated with two warehouse buildings (Areas C and F), were also found. Part of a possible timber bridge pier base was recorded on the foreshore to the southwest of the quay (Area F). On Area B, to the north, lay a mid- to late Roman masonry building which incorporated a tessellated bath, mosaic floor and hypocaust during its development. Roman activity was traced over the site from the 1st to the 5th Century and was also represented by mudbrick buildings (some of which had been burnt in a major fire) and timber-lined drains.   The dark grey silts or waterlaid deposits sealing the latest Roman deposits were cut by many Saxon pits and two wells, and also by two sunken-floored buildings (Areas A and B).

The natural river gravels were uncovered over most of the site, together with a small area of the brickearth cap along the northern edge of the site. The earliest manmade features on the site were pits and gullies of the Roman period, from the 1st Century onwards, and seen in the northern part of the site. The unusually large area of excavation made it possible to trace the alignment and fall of the gullies over long distances. These features produced quite a large amount of animal bone, pottery and metalwork. The Rangoon Street site lay just within the walls of the Roman city, and well back from the main road (Fenchurch Street); it is likely that this area was taken up with gardens, or given over to industrial purposes, such as butchers' yards or even rubbish tips, as suggested by the plentiful animal bone and pottery. In the northern part of the site, the Roman features were sealed by about 0.3m of dark earth, deposited some time at the end of the Roman period, or later. It contained two human skeletons, buried together in the same grave, their heads to the north, the head of the upper (female) in the lap of the lower (male?). These unusual arrangements suggested some pagan burial practice.  Cut into the dark earth was a large Medieval chalk-lined cesspit, containing fragments of painted window glass, decorated with a heraldic lion and foliage patterns; and a pattern of small rectangular pits, filled with rammed chalk and gravel, perhaps post-pads of a timber-framed structure. South of Rangoon Street, the lower part of a timber-lined well survived, cut into the gravels and containing large amounts of 14th- and 15th Century pottery, including a watering-pot. The most conspicuous structure on the site was the East India Company's Tea and Drugs warehouse, built in 1796, whose massive brick and stone foundations covered most of the site. Surveyors' plans and elevations of this building survive in the India Office Archives. Associated with the warehouse, but not appearing on any surveyors' drawings, was an underground brick structure, identified as an ice-well. This consisted of a brick dome and cylinder, about 3m deep altogether, set in the natural gravel, down to the top of London Clay. It may originally have been built before the warehouse, but was retained when the warehouse was constructed. Rangoon Street was removed by the present redevelopment.",

Brickearth levels dropped to the west, by c 0.30m, and were recorded at 12.55m OD in Trench 3, and at 12.40m OD within Trenches 1 and 2. The brickearth within Trenches 5 and 6 was slightly lower at 12.20m OD where it measured 0.40m thick. The changes in levels of the brickearth on the site may indicate that the brickearth surface was truncated by features such as pits, ditches, ponds or quarrying, possibly dating to the Medieval period or earlier.  The earliest feature recorded on the site during the evaluation was cut into the natural brickearth in Trench 4. This was a possible late Medieval feature, in the form of a butt-end of a ditch or southern side of a pit, and contained 15th Century pottery. Trenches 2 and 3 contained an undated alluvial deposit. This may indicate fluvial deposits within the middle and south-western parts of the site, resulting from water flowing over the site at some point.  Overlying the natural within each trench was the black gritty silt deposits of the postMedieval Holywell Mount 'laystall' (dung heap), measuring up to 3.80m thick (in unbasemented parts of the site) and recorded at a maximum height of 16.56m OD. This contained numerous sherds of 17th Century pottery, clay tobacco pipes, building material, animal bones and a few tin-glazed wall tiles.  Overlying the dump deposits of the 'laystall', in trenches 1-3, late Post Medieval structural remains were recorded; including the brick floor of an early 19th Century building in Trench 2, granite setts and brick walls. These features were located in the top 1.5m of the site, in unbasemented areas, and were immediately overlain by modern concrete and hardcore.  Only one feature pre-dating the Post Medieval period was recorded on the site (cut feature in Trench 4); however the possibility remains for additional earlier features located at the base of the sequence, cut into the natural brickearth. No human remains were recovered from the site despite numerous documentary references to burials in the area, and the potential for human remains must remain a possibility.  *natural gravels were located at between 11.56m OD and 12.20m OD*",

This ditch lay in front of and c.6m to the north of the line of the wall of the late 1st Century to early 2nd Century Roman defences.  The backfill of this ditch which contained disarticulated skeletons, was the first of six successive ditches or re-cuttings. The second is late Roman or Early Medieval in origin, its backfill containing a Medieval bone skate, and the third is dated to the late 13th Century. The fourth ditch was cut at the beginning of the 16th Century and was recut, after silting up, after 1630. The recut was systematically backfilled in the mid-17th Century, marking an end to the defences.  Later features included: a horncore-lined drainage ditch; rubbish pits; chalk or mortar foundations of 17th Century date; and 18th Century brick-lined wells. The 17th Century ditch backfill contained large quantities of glass vessel fragments and glass-working debris, possibly from Mansell's glassworks, Austin Friars. Large quantities of 17th Century pottery were also recovered from the backfill. Much is in good condition with many complete profiles. Post Medieval redwares and Border wares predominate.

Highest surviving natural deposits were brickearth silts at 12. Om OD in F1. They had been cut by a feature that continued beyond the area of the excavation, a quarry pit or part of the extra-mural city ditch. This was at some distance north of the line of the city wall - presumably to allow for gatehouses or other works. Shaft F2 was much closer to the line of the city wall and the Late Medieval City Ditch, thought to have been dug by Mayor Joceline in 1477, had truncated natural Terrace Gravel to 8.77m OD. In the bottom load of the sediment was a fragment of a Post Medieval Redware pitcher dated 1450-1600 (""bottom load"" is the large particles that shuffle along the bottom of a waterflow, rather than the fine particles in suspension or salts in solution, the dating of the vessel means that it is recorded twice on the OASIS form below - Medieval and Post Medieval). Through the ditch sediments was cut a straight-sided, arched brick sewer. It is of a size and pattern similar to that built by Wren about St Paul's and is thought to be of a similar date - the end of the 17th or the beginning of the 18th Century. At l.4m wide it is a substantial stnf:cture and is one of the versions of the Irongate Sewer, the sewer that succeeded the city ditch. A successor egg-shaped sewer had been tunnelled beneath it.  *The depth of ditch deposits (to 8.77m OD), into natural gravel, indicate the degree of excavation required to ensure a flow around the city, diverting the waters of the Walbrook stream to create a moat.

The investigations revealed over 4m of Roman stratigraphy in an area which overlies the northeast corner of the early 2nd Century basilica. The earliest activity comprised brickearth quarrying succeeded by both industrial and domestic building deposits. These were superseded by the basilica of which at least three opus signinum floors were recorded.  Following its demise the roof collapsed; this in turn was sealed by the fallen south wall of the nave and activity in the area appears to have ceased until the 10th Century.  Also recorded was the 14m high west wall of the mid-15th Century Leadenhall. The foundations comprised a series of relieving arches, which themselves are partially founded on the Roman foundations of the basilica.   From October 1985 to September 1986 extensive excavations were conducted, in addition to the preliminary work reported above. This part of the project was designed to examine a large area over and immediately north of the site of the suggested Roman basilica.  Evidence was found for the initial clearance of tree cover, quarry pits, ditches, a building with earth-fast posts and a thick fire-debris horizon. All these were sealed by six brickearth-walled buildings, pottery from which has been dated to AD60-80; the associated pits, wells, alleys and middens were also excavated. All these features were swept away by a major redevelopment of the site which saw the introduction of a large masonry public building extending beyond the southern, western and eastern limits of excavation. A well-made road lay to its north, with brickearth and timber buildings beyond that. Major structural modifications to the masonry building were recorded, as was the sequence of development in many of the rooms, together with the complex pattern of demolition and robbing. The Roman finds were typical of a Roman civilian settlement: nothing of a military character has yet been identified on the site. The Roman pottery constitutes a large assemblage, early Flavian-4th Century in date, and including a great range of imports. There are very good examples of unusual types, for example hollow-foot amphora, Rhineland mortaria, and glazed ware from central Gaul and south-east England. Glass vessels included chariot and athletes' cups and a double-handed cup (scyphos). Several iron waterpipe collars were recovered.  The road was resurfaced some nine times, but a thick layer of silt sealed the latest surface, into which a series of Saxon pits and other features were cut.  Much structural evidence survived of the 15th Century Leadenhall market, as the trenches straddled the N part of the quadrangular market building, locating its truncated foundations. A fragment of the exterior wall of the west range survived to a height of 11.2m between modern buildings. It displayed evidence for an open ground floor for trade and, above, two floors for storage of wheat. Cellars built on the site of the north wing, after its demolition in 1795, incorporated over 100 dressed mouldings and blocks from the superstructure of the building.",

Associated with these were a small chalk-lined well and a chalk-lined cesspit which used the ragstone wall as its southern limit. This occupation made substantial use of gravel dumping to eliminate the incline from Ludgate Hill to the city wall.

Three trenches were excavated followed by a watching brief over the rest of the area.  A shallow ditch (Period I) marked out the line of a north-south Roman street (Period II), probably laid out in the Flavian period. The area to the west of the street may initially have been external (Period II) but subsequently a series of Flavian buildings, the latest of which was destroyed by fire, fronted onto the street (Periods III-IV). In Period V (late Flavian-Hadrianic) successive buildings on the west side of the street had a portico at the frontage and were probably shops, while a cellared building immediately to the north had a large storage tank built into its front wall. By contrast, development on the esat side of the street during Periods I-V was limited to pits and gravelled external areas, and further east still, where the ground fell away into the Walbrook Valley, stone-founded Roman domestic buildings were set well back from the street. Buildings across the entire site were destroyed in the Hadrianic fire at the end of Period V, but in Period VI (Hadrianic-early 3rd Century) the site was redeveloped much as before. Further shops, one of which had amphorae set inside its front wall, were constructed on the west side of the street, but the area to the east remained open except for a stone building at the extreme east of the site. Apart from flooding in Period IV, the street was frequently resurfaced to keep pace with the rising buildings. In Period VII (3rd Century and later) however a series of crude timber buildings erected near the street did not align with it, suggesting its disuse sometime before dark earth was deposited over the site in Period VI.  Above dark earth a second north-south Late Saxon street was laid out immediately to the W of its predecessor, and represents the forerunner of Bow Lane. The first street surfaces with structures on their east edge (Periods IX-X) are undated, but later wattle and daub buildings (Periods XI-XII), one of which incorporated an oven, are dated to the 10th-12th Century. A sunken-floored structure set well back from the street became disused in the late 10th Century, but two other sunken structures may have predated the street. Various rubbish pits (Period XIII) were dug in the central part of the site in the Early Medieval period, but by the 14th Century the site was covered by a series of Medieval stone-cellared buildings (Period XIV), two of which were refurbished in the Post Medieval period (Period XV).",

The building was used for sawing and storing timber, which was conveyed to barges on the Lea Navigation by two travelling cranes. The rails from these cranes ended at raised tipping wharves, which can be seen today. A third tipping wharf, without rails, can be found to the south, and was probably related to the loading of timber from a contemporary building at the south of the site.

Natural deposits across the site consisted of alluvial deposits, one of which contained a number of eroded tile and pottery fragments of Roman date. The earliest well-dated material (12th Century) was recorded at the north end of the site; this was composed of a series of dumps and naturally accumulated flood deposits. A gravel bank which ran from the north-east to south-west probably represents the confluence of the Fleet River and the Thames at this period.In the main trench the earliest structural activity was dated to the mid-14th Century. This was composed of a massive reclamation dump, associated with a Thames riverside wall constructed in chalk and built on the contemporary foreshore. The construction of the wall was aided by the digging of a shallow foundation trench which was shored with a large wattle fence. The dumping and the wall construction were contemporary in date. The reclamation activity extended the Thames waterfront towards the south by about 50m.Sporadic features recorded on the top of the dumped deposits were sealed by a fire horizon of late 17th Century date, probably the Great Fire. The area to the south of the site appeared to have been reclaimed around this period with a timber revetment recorded at the southern limit of excavation. This revetment and associated reclamation is thought to represent the construction of the new quays during the post-Fire rebuilding of this area of the waterfront. The area behind the revetment was reclaimed and consolidated by the driving of more than 700 timber piles. The timbers, when examined, were identified as being reused and were considered to have been originally derived from one or more 17th/18th Century vessels. Many of the timbers were painted and several were moulded.On the reclaimed land a series of Post Medieval brick walls, foundations and cellar floors was recorded. One later cellar floor included a series of three brick-built (baking?) oven bases. During the early 19th Century the City Gas Works was constructed on the site, and several structures associated with the gasworks were recorded. Completing the sequence was a forgotten Second World War public air-raid shelter.Waterfront dumps produced several important groups of Medieval organic material. The shoes and pattens from the site are an important addition to the collection of Medieval footwear from London. One of the shoes was stuffed with seeds of cannabis sativa. A number of scabbards, a glove and some highly decorated fragments from unidentified leather objects were also recovered. Copper-alloy material appears to come from a later Medieval workshop, including a copper-alloy coil and a rod, which may be the forms in which the metal was traded in the Medieval period. An important find relating to this was a pilgrim's badge of St Eloi, the patron saint of smiths and other metalworkers. Pottery includes some late Medieval imports, from Spain and the Southern Netherlands.",

The investigation produced evidence of activity from the 1st Century onwards. The Roman sequence included three phrases of occupation, the first and third of them terminated by fire-destruction horizons which may represent the mid-1st Century Boudican and early 2nd Century Hadrianic fires respectively. The structures destroyed by these fires were probably aligned with the main Roman east-west road to the south beneath modern Cheapside and possibly, in one case, to a north-south road to the west: that leading to the south gate of the Roman fort (note that this road is different to that found at OST82).  Above these deposits was a band of dark soil indicating a prolonged interruption of the sequence between Roman and Medieval periods. The latter was represented by pits and traces of timber buildings, followed by a series of 13th- and 14th Century stone foundations, possibly of the Medieval Cross Keys Inn on Wood Street and the alley which divided it from the churchyard of St Peter Cheap. A Post Medieval well and drains were almost certainly from the Inn, which occupied the site until it was replaced in the 1860s by the building demolished for the present redevelopment.",

The pits were roughly three metres across by a metre and a half deep. They cut through a number of deposits to reach an undisturbed brown gravely clay. Pit 1 showed some broken brick and a thin layer of mortar that could be the remnants of the original Tudor yard. It may be related to the first phase of alteration in the 18th Century but was covered after 1717, a halfpenny coin of 1717 providing a TPQ date. In 1787 the coach yard was paved, so does the surface relate to this or to the Adam period (John Adams mid 18th Century onwards) when the basement was built. If it is then the rubble layer may have come from the demolition of the Tudor east wing. Pit 2 showed much the same as Pit 1 but with a wall running north to south. This may be the feature shown on 19th Century maps, possibly a shrubbery planted to screen the stables. Pit 3 was filled before recording. June 1992 saw the monitoring of a service trench between the stable and the house. It cut through the base of a water tower identified on all 19th Century maps up to 1865. A culvert was found presumably 18th Century, for collecting water. Two more parallel walls were found that probably relate to the walls found in tree-pit 2. The service trench in September 1992 ran from the northwest tower along the wall of the house to feed into an existing drain. At the east end it cut a culvert suggested to be 19th Century by the colour of brick used. Again the walls of the shrubbery seem to be apparent here. July 1992 saw the monitoring of the lower steps of the eastern side. This showed a core of Tudor bricks although it seemed unlikely that it represents this period due to the missing bricks and mortar.

The report deals primarily with work carried out at 280 Bishopsgate, but also assesses previous excavations in the vicinity, which took place between 1982 and 1985.  The earliest use of the site was during the Roman period, when it was used for quarrying, agriculture and as part of a major Roman cemetery from which about 150 graves were excavated.  In the 12th Century, tenements were probably constructed alongside Bishopsgate and a water supply system was constructed along the edge of the road.  In 1197, the priory and hospital of St Mary-without-Bishopsgate (commonly known as St Mary Spital) was founded.  The excavations have located: the eastern end of the church with a later Lady Chapel and south aisle, probably constructed in c1400, a cloister to the north, the south end of the canon's dormitory, a kitchen to the east, the canon's infirmary and a number of other structures.  The Medieval cemetery was located to the south of the priory and hospital, of which about 10,5000 skeletons have been excavated.  The cemetery covered an area of c5500mÂ².  The foundations of an open air pulpit and the well-preserved remains of a charnel house were recorded in the centre of the cemetery.  Evidence for burial practice was recovered.  A Medieval road that entered the precinct from the south and west of the cemetery through a gatehouse.  A row of tenements consisting of chalk and tile foundations, probably supporting timber-framed structures was located on the outside of this road.  After the dissolution in 1539, two aristocratic mansions were built on the land.  The Medieval infirmary range was converted into tenements and, in the 17th Century, a new street was laid eastwards.  The southern part of the precinct was converted into an artillery ground in 1538, used for cottage industries and for artillery practice.  A high brick wall surrounded the artillery ground and the multi-roomed residence of the Master Gunner of England.  A star-shaped fort, comprising a ditch and possible bank was built during the English Civil War within the artillery ground.  From the late 17th Century onwards Spitalfields was developed for suburban housing.  The cellars of these houses and associated cess pits were found across the site together with numerous finds and environmental samples.",

There followed a sequence of 1st and early 2nd Century interior and exterior surfaces. A sunken Flavian tile and ragstone stairway had been cut through these surfaces in the west of the site, and apparently led to a cellar which must have been situated immediately north of the site. One side of this stairway was incorporated into, and its alignment followed, the construction of a major north to south wall of mid-2nd Century date.

The southern trench was abandoned directly the concrete slab was removed as an intrusive sewer-pipe had reduced the area available to an inexcavable amount and work was therefore concentrated in the northern area.

All site records were related to the ordnance survey datum (bench mark of 12.57m O.D. on the north east corner of 66 Royal Mint Street).  The evaluation found that the site have been heavily quarried in the 17th Century subsequent to which the ground level was consolidated during the rest of the 17th Century. The site had been open for some time, and then, from the mid 17th Century, the site began to become built up. The consolidation of the land after quarryjng may have taken place in preparation for the development of the site during this period.  *Truncated natural was observed at between 8.32m OD in trench A and 8.70m OD in trench B*",

The archaeological results within the area of the proposed lift pit revealed the city ditch, which had cut into river terrace sands and gravels of the Taplow Terrace at around +9m OD. The city ditch was aligned in an east-west direction and the width not established as it extended beyond the trench. The auger holes revealed that the ditch was 2m deep. There was no evidence of the Roman ditch, as it had been recut in the Medieval and Post Medieval periods. The earliest fills encountered were largely clay-rich, apparently derived from standing water or waterlogged deposition, with evidence of soil formation and some dumped material indicated by root fibres, bone and shell. These fills are likely to be Medieval or postMedieval in date. The upper fills were a dark brown-black clayey silt dating to the 16th Century.  Recovered from a 1m square hand excavated test pit, located within the northern end of the ditch, were fragments of residual Roman roofing tile (tegula), brick and part of a combed box-flue tile. Within the service tunnel the base of the Roman city wall was observed overlying natural sand. Medieval and Post Medieval roof tiles and a number of bricks dating to the mid/late 15th and early 16th Century were also found. However, the ditch fill produced over 1,300 sherds of industrial earthenware ceramics dating to c 1550 -1580. These included distillation flasks called cucurbits, used in the distillation of strong acids required for parting precious metals. Also recovered were sherds of shallow, thick-walled crucibles used for melting metals, including four triangular Hessian crucibles and fragments from two ceramic moulds.  The industrial ceramics recovered from the city ditch at Roman House provide the largest single assemblage of Post Medieval metalworking vessels found in the City of London to date. In view of the significance of this assemblage, it is intended to publish a short summary report in the journal the London Archaeologist. The article will include the profile of the postMedieval city ditch as found from the results of the Augerhole survey, and discuss the assemblage of Post Medieval ceramics. Both topics will be compared with Grimes' work carried out in the same area between 1946 and 1948.  *The natural gravel was observed at c 0.9m OD.*",

During 1949-50 Grimes directed the excavations of five areas on the site of 71-80 Great Tower Street and 37-41 Mark Lane. Archaeological survival varied from truncated natural brickearth to 2.13m of deposits above natural (Grimes 1968, 123-4). The top of natural brickearth is estimated at 12.22m OD. The earliest recorded features were a shallow Romano-British pit and a ditch aligned northwest-southeast. These features were sealed by dumps of burnt daub and debris from the Hadrianic fire (c AD120-5). In one area this dumping was preceded by in situ burning or scorching of the natural brickearth. Subsequent Romano-British activity consisted of external gravel surfaces (paths or alleys?), soil and rubbish dumping, plus the digging of a number of pits and linear gullies. These gullies may represent the division of the area into various units or properties after the Hadrianic fire. Structural evidence was limited to post-holes - some of which may represent fence-lines - and one possible cob wall foundation trench. Two features in area 3 described by Grimes as 'hut-hollows' have been reinterpreted as sunken-floored buildings, probably of Saxo-Norman date. One unstratified find from the site is a fragment of an 11th Century Anglo-Scandinavian decorative mount. Two similar decorative mounts are known from the Smithfield area of London (Webster 1984, 108-9). Medieval features consisted of rubbish pits, a barrel-lined well or soak-away and a rectangular chalk-lined cesspit, with later brick additions. The 1950s' redevelopment of the area between Mark Lane and Mincing Lane revealed a 13th Century London-ware jug (MoL acc no.

A series of pits and linear features were recorded which cut the natural or disturbed gravel. No dating evidence was recovered except for animal bone fragments one of which has been Carbon-14 dated to AD 432-644 (see ELO7352). In the centre of the site was a number of 16th-17th Century intercutting gravel extraction pits.

Excavations were carried out in the north and at the south end of the site.  The earliest indication of activity occurred in the north area where the natural gravels were cut by a drainage ditch of early 2nd Century date, and by the construction of the Roman defensive wall (which is dated elsewhere to the late 2nd-early 3rd Century). On this site the wall had become incorporated into a property boundary, its outer face forming part of the western boundary of the site. A total length of about 22.5m was recorded, with a 10m stretch surviving 3m in height up to the third tile course and with numerous post-Roman repairs. Some 3m in advance of the wall the contemporary V-shaped ditch was recorded in both the north and south areas of the site: it was about 2m deep and about 4m wide.  The remains of Bastion 4 were located in the south and a hitherto unknown bastion, to be called B4A, was discovered in the north area. The foundations of these bastions were rectangular in shape and projected 5.4m (B4A) and a minimum 4.7m (B4) from the wall, B4A's foundations were coursed chalk and ragstone being 'stepped' into the bottom of the V-shaped ditch. The solid, D-shaped superstructure of B4A was partly at least composed of reused monumental masonry including fragments of an inscribed Roman tombstone, probably of early 3rd Century date and was not keyed into the wall. The 3m high stretch of wall and the foundation of B4A have been preserved within the present building.  In the Medieval period, a defensive ditch was constructed and infilled in the late 12th-13th Century when B4A was demolished and B4 apparently demolished, though since documentary evidence indicates that B4 survived into the 17th Century, this may only have been partial.  During a watching brief on the east side of the site, the west edge of a ditch was recorded at a low level and is likely to have been part of a later Medieval defensive ditch: the city ditch.  Post Medieval horncore lined pits dating to the late 16th-17th Century were found, two of which were associated with the casting of gun-metal. Towards the end of the 17th Century domestic properties were established. In the south a basement containing a brick water channel and well were recorded: they possibly represented the remains of a wash-house. The backfill of the well contained a substantial quantity of material associated with glassmaking in the late 17th-early 18th Century. In the north area, two brick-lined cesspits were constructed against the city wall where they probably demarcated two properties. Both were disused by the early-mid-18th Century. One of the cesspits was infilled about 1770, probably as the result of a household clearance: it contained a large collection of pottery and glassware many near-complete items and an animal bone assemblage which included an angora rabbit and a linnet.  In the later 19th Century the Metropolitan Bonded Warehouse was constructed, storing tea and cork; features connected with this and the Irongate sewer, which ran north-south beneath the warehouse, were recorded.",

The archaeological investigations encountered fluvial sands from 0.80m OD, and the uppermost archaeological horizon at c.3.85m OD. This demonstrated the presence of a stratified archaeological sequence measuring 2.95m in thickness.  The earliest identified horizon of naturally deposited sands and gravels (Phase 1/2) was identified during localised augering. These interventions were too localised and limited in size however, to be able to make wider inferences regarding the underlying topography of the eyot on which the site is located. Waterlain alluvium was identified along the northern boundary of the site and may represent the presence of a channel or inlet within close proximity. The discovery of residual Mesolithic/Neolithic implements within later deposits suggests that the natural topography of the island was impacted upon during Roman landscaping/development of the area. No further traces of Prehistoric occupation/exploitation were identified.  Eight broad phases of Roman activity were recorded across the site (Phases 3a-h). These comprised an initial phase of ground raising/consolidation, followed by mid to late 1st Century construction and development primarily associated with industry. The latter inferred the production of leaded copper and copper working within the boundaries of the site, and hot ironworking in close proximity. Potentially associated with these activities were at least two structures, defined by brickearth partition walls. One example is likely to have fronted onto Road 1, whereas a second example is suspected to have fronted a subsidiary road running perpendicular, or parallel to the road.  Both structures remained in use until the early 2nd Century. During the lifespans of these buildings copper production continued within the area but at a reduced capacity. A direct correlation was observed between the reduction of industry and an increase in domestic activity across the Site. A brief shift in property boundaries was suggested by at least two phases of east-west aligned ditches within the south-eastern quadrant of Area B. These were distinctive in differing in alignment from the surrounding architecture.  A high status building dating from the early 2nd Century dominated the northern excavation Area A1 and extended into adjacent Area A2. The complex was interpreted as a potential bathhouse, and comprised at least four rooms, one of which appeared to be a Laconicum, or sweating room. Although the precise function of the remaining rooms remains unclear, it is apparent that the two northernmost rooms underwent numerous modifications into the mid/late 2nd Century. These modifications included the robbing/removal of wall facings, the laying of opus signinum surfaces and installation of additional internal structures, including a drain and flue. The nature of repairs within the Laconicum however inferred that even if the complex was initially designed as a bathhouse, it might not have remained in use as this throughout its entire lifespan. Dumped debris suggested that parts of the complex began to fall out of use by the late 2nd to early 3rd Century.  Activity within the central and southern excavation Areas A2 and B during the 2nd to early 3rd Centuries comprised an initial phase of dumping and instatement of opus signinum surfaces. These surfaces lay at a comparable elevation to those within Area A1, but are likely to have been part of a separate complex. The replacement of the earlier brickearth partition by stone walls were also dated to this period, and is therefore likely to have been part of a widespread development scheme taking place during the early 2nd Century. Construction increased further by the mid 2nd Century, by which time 7 distinct spaces or rooms could be identified across Area B. Stone walls defined the three western rooms whereas those to the east appeared to lie within a timber-framed building. Many of these rooms illustrated numerous phases of use. This was particularly evident for those rooms within the timber-framed building, which inferred that the complex was rebuilt/redeveloped at least 2-3 times. Activity subsequently decreased during the late 2nd/early 3rd Century within these areas. Former property boundaries were generally maintained but modified.   Widespread robbing trenches and demolition debris suggested an occupation decline during the late 3rd to 4th Centuries (Phase 4a). Material contained within the debris, such as plaster, and other high status materials are likely to have derived from the bathhouse, and might infer something of the original design and appearance of some of the rooms. Such debris did not however indicate a total abandonment of the area. Refuse and cess pits, postholes and secondary robbing cuts within Area B, suggested that occupation continued in this vicinity, within the boundaries of the earlier structures.  Evidence of Late Saxon activity (Phase 4b) comprised two pit clusters found containing material dated up to 1050/1150. These clusters were extremely localised and suggested that certain property boundaries may have remained in use, despite extensive robbing of the superstructures. The Late Saxon pottery recovered from the Site represented the largest assemblage of this date by comparison to the other Thameslink assessment areas.   Three broad phases of Medieval activity were identified across the excavation areas (Phase 5). These comprised several construction schemes dated between the 11th and 13th Centuries followed by robbing dated up to the 15th Century. Earlier walls dated between the 11th and 12th Centuries and comprised chalk walls in the north-east of the excavation area, which incorporated Roman material within the construction and had been founded directly upon Roman foundations. These features pre-dated the documented relocation of St Thomas's Hospital to the east side of Borough High Street during the early 13th Century. Evidence of this complex was encountered along the southern limits of excavation in the form of chalk piers with relieving arches. Material recovered from garden soils adjacent to this boundary contained high status material potentially derived from a religious establishment in close proximity, and may therefore also relate to St Thomas's Hospital. A number of stone walls were identified within the central excavation area, which respected the property alignments of the chalk arches. The difference in materials might suggest this to have been an entirely separate property, or a different scheme of works within the hospital precinct.  During the late 15th to early 17th Century (Phase 6a) construction and redevelopment focussed on the western half of the excavation areas, and presumably related to properties that formerly fronted onto Borough High Street. A number of the brick walls incorporated reused Roman materials, and had been founded over earlier Roman masonry. This suggested that elements of the bathhouse complex were visible at this time and integrated into postMedieval constructions. Additional construction comprised walls built of chalk, ragstone and reused ashlar blocks dated to the 16th/17th Centuries. These were predominantly located within the southern two thirds of the excavation area.  A further series of chalk, brick and ragstone walls were attributed to mid/late 17th and 18th Century modifications (Phase 6b/6c). These related to at least 2-3 former properties that fronted onto Borough High Street. Internal walls were constructed, localised reinforcements installed and repairs indicative of numerous modifications over a relatively short time span identified. Cess pits associated with the southernmost of these properties were also identified, and construction began to encroach on the eastern excavation areas from the late 17th and early 18th Century. Cartographic sources illustrate a number of these properties, and suggest that the south-eastern quadrant of the excavation area was located within the open precinct of St Thomas's Hospital at this time. The lack of development within certain areas is therefore a direct result of differing property boundaries, and limitations to development as a result of the hospital precinct.  Expansion and sub-division of pre-existing property boundaries continued during the later 18th and 19th Centuries (Phase 6d). Pre-existing walls were repaired and modified, earlier cess pits fell out of use, and a number of brick floors (basement level) were installed. The destruction of earlier properties, perhaps to make way for redevelopment of the wider area, was inferred by the presence of 13th to 15th Century building material within dump layers of this phase. Similarly to earlier phases (6b and 6c) many of these modifications can be traced using cartographic sources. Discrepancies between the archaeological and the cartographic record however, suggest that some of construction schemes in the south of the excavation area were relatively short lived.  Properties comprising the earlier terrace were demolished by 1846 and the area landscaped as part of the redevelopment of the precinct of St Thomas's Hospital (Phase 7). The gardens/courtyard that encompassed the Site were short-lived, and followed by the construction of properties 11-15 Borough High Street by c.1863. These properties remained on the site until their demolition in 2010/2011. The depth of the footings associated with these properties effectively subdivided the site into the three main excavation areas: A1, A2 and B.  *Natural fluvial sands were observed at 0.8m OD.*",

A short watching brief was carried out immediately afterwards when the piling contractors were on site.  The main objective was to try and establish, if possible, the line of the original channel of a Walbrook tributary which was known to have crossed the area. It was predicted that the Walbrook should traverse the southwestern quarter of the site, from northeast to southwest. The depth of the double basements in the north of the site determined the eventual size of excavation. In the south half of site, massive Victorian foundations also dictated the areas to be excavated. As modern footings crossed the site, east/west, three discrete areas of excavation were created. During the excavation, up to 2m of stratigraphy were encountered over the south area of the site. Substantial remains of a timber revetment and part of a wooden trackway were uncovered.

The trial pit measured approximately 1.40m E-W by 1.60m N-S. It was excavated to a maximum depth of 1.80m on the south side and 1.16m on the north side.

The bricks and mortar suggest that the earliest walls probably date from the late 17th or early 18th Centuries when the Market was first built. The other walls are presumably later partitions. The survival is clearly very good, with remains laying immediately beneath the concrete slab which forms the Market surface.

A series of five trenches across the whole site were evaluated archaeologically. No deposits earlier than the 19th Century have survived in any of the trenches, with the exception of the truncated deposits of mid-late 17th Century date in Trench 2. Nineteenth Century cellaring has truncated earlier deposits. Within Trenches 1 and 3-5 these 19th Century cellars overlay archaeologically sterile alluvium.  The structural remains at the base of Trench 2 can best be interpreted as foundation walls and these and a well were abutted and filled with material of similar date, ie mid 17th Century. The clay pipe, pottery and brick typologies indicate a date immediately after the Restoration (1660-1680).  The map evidence supports the argument that this part of the site was developed in the period 1660-1680. Faithome and Newcourt's map shows that there were buildings standing on the south of the site in 1658, but not in the area examined by Trench 2. Morgan's map of 1682 shows that the area in the vicinity of Trench 2 had been built on by this date.  The destruction horizon recorded in Trench 5 has been dated to the mid-20th Century. Documentary evidence suggests that this layer is the result of enemy bombing on the night of 29th/30th December 1940. The former Hermitage Wharf immediately south of the evaluation site, across Wapping High Street, is known to have been targeted on that date.

The natural gravels sloped down in this corner, but were truncated elsewhere on the site. The earliest activity on the site was the cutting of a gravel quarry pit, backfilled in the early 2nd Century. This was immediately south of a metalled surface, possibly an alley or road, of contemporary date. In the north-east corner of the site the downward slope of natural was levelled and a brickearth building constructed during the early 2nd Century. The structure had at least three rooms and a narrow corridor; one room had a gravelled floor while the others used brickearth. The internal walls were of wattle and daub construction. The building, and an associated external area, with a wooden box-section drain and boundary fence, were occupied for a relatively short period as stages of disuse were dated to the mid-2nd Century. By the late 2nd Century a substantial northwest-southeast fence alignment ran across this area; to be followed in the early 3rd Century by an east-west tile pathway. Late 3rd Century dumping completed the horizontal sequence. A large number of truncated pits were recorded, with a date-range of early 2nd Century to c 1500. Of note were two very large square rubbish pits and a smaller wattle-lined pit, probably at the rear of a property fronting Coleman Street, all dated to the 12th Century.

Most of the site had been severely truncated by the basements of the standing buildings, although horizontal stratigraphy did survive under the cobbling of Elliot's Court.  The gravel terrace on the site sloped down to the south and west. Some levelling activity preceded the construction of several kilns in the Roman period. The structure of only one of these survived: no wasters were recovered, but the character of the kiln would suggest that it had been used for the manufacture of fine pottery. Demolition debris observed in the watching brief suggests that there were at least six other such features on the site.  These kilns were replaced by a large octagonal building, 16m in diameter, which was associated with large-scale terracing. This building was probably surrounded by an ambulatory 3.75m wide. The whole building would then have enclosed an area of 520sq m. It had been completely robbed but red-painted wall plaster, ragstone and opus signinum probably featured in its construction. This building has been tentatively interpreted as a Romano-Celtic temple.The robbing was followed by the construction of a large masonry building of at least nine rooms. This building was rebuilt at least once, and at a later date a hypocaust was added. A coin of 335-41 dates the demolition and robbing of the building to the mid-4th Centuryy or later; its function is unclear.  Then 0.8m of dark earth accumulated on the site. Several pits cutting into this deposit, including a timber-lined well of Saxo-Norman date, attest to occupation of the site before the construction of a number of chalk buildings, probably in the 13th Century.

A large feature containing one piece of struck flint possibly dating to the Bronze Age was partially excavated and it extended north beyond the trench. A Medieval brickearth quarry pit was found which been backfilled in the mid to late 13th Century and a chalk footing was seen. A number of Post-Medieval features were found. Some disturbed gravel and dumped deposits were beneath a north-south wall, which may have been built at the same time as an east-west one in a separate trench. The second was built of materials dating from the late Medieval period to the 17th Century. 17th Century horticultural activity was seen in the form of dumped deposits and possibly four bedding trenches. Artefacts from these features place them in the late 17th Century. An isolated post-hole was found. Pottery from its fill has the date range 1580 to 1800.The construction of a land-drain and a north-south wall which respected it can be dated to the early 18th Century. An east-west wall was built of the same building material; this incorporated a cavity drain which also fed into the land-drain. A brick pier base to the north of these walls used similar mortar but could not be directly linked to a structure. The use of stock bricks to build footings for timber joists to the west of the north-south early Post-Medieval wall implies continued use of the previous structures into the 19th Century. It also implies that in the 19th Century, the north-west corner of the site would have been internal. Layers containing 19th Century material and capped with a crude Tarmac surface against an early 18th Century wall confirm the continued use. Two linear cuts suggest that the robbing of some walls took place in the 19th Century. One ran north-south, the other east-west. Demolition debris sealing the majority of earlier archaeological deposits attests to the reworking of the site in the 19th and 20th Centuries. An undated pit and post-hole were found.

Certainly there is little palaeoenvironmental or geoarchaeololgical potential for the site and the impact on any archaeological remains along the river frontage of the building in particular is considered minimal. However, previous archaeological work and to some degree this geoarchaeological watching brief, has found significant archaeology in the central area of the building which would be greatly affected by enlarging the basement area.

The earliest feature, an east to west road linking the Aldgate area to the forum, was laid directly onto the natural brickearth. This road was delimited on its north side by a ditch which was later scoured out and recut to take an enclosed wooden drain. The road gravels were then extended over the drain to link up with a courtyard area, to the north. Five road surfaces were discernible, all probably 1st Century. The partition wall of a clay and timber building was found at the edge of the site above an area of yard gravels. A small area of associated floor surface had been badly burnt. A north-west to south-east ditch, probably a property division of the 2nd Century, cut through all the gravel surfaces of court and road, but unfortunately modern truncation had removed any relationship between the building and the ditch. On the west side a structure represented by posts set into the yard surface north of the road, was 2m wide and ran north for at least 4m before being truncated by a late 2nd or 3rd Century ditch. This ran north-east  to south-west across the whole site, cutting the earlier ditch at right angles; it was in use for some time, being continually cut back and repaired as its retaining posts collapsed or rotted. The last phase of Roman activity was a series of almost perfectly circular pits; there was no sign of dark earth.The only surviving Medieval features were a chalk well and intrusive pits, some single, some complex, recut five or six times, the earliest producing 11th- or perhaps 10th Century pottery. Brick cellar floors of Post Medieval buildings survived immediately above the Roman road surfaces. In two instances very deep strongrooms survived: one was probably vaulted, extending under an alley to the west, Fenchurch Buildings; the other to the east was originally reached by ladder, and later was refloored and provided with a brick stair.",

The evaluation consisted of five test pits, three dug solely for archaeological purposes.  Evidence of early Roman settlement, predating the Boudiccan destruction of London and then rebuilding was found through excavation.  A series of renewed floor surfaces attest to the rebuilding and some of these building were probably contemporary with the first basilica-forum situated to the west.  Evidence for construction of the second larger basilica-forum, c AD 100, was recorded in the form of floor surfaces from the eastern wing.  Remains of a north-south aligned Roman road were found on the eastern edge of the side  *Natural gravels were observed between 10.05m and 10.10m OD, probably truncated breickearth was observed overlying this to between 10.80 and 10.85m OD.*","A polygon covering the approximate area of the site was drawn at a scale of 1:1,250 using the OS MasterMap data as a base."

There is a low to moderate potential for Prehistoric remains, as features of Bronze to Iron age, as well as earlier flint and pottery, have been found in the area.    The site is thought to have a low potential for Saxon, Roman and Medieval remains, due to the distance from the Roman settlement and relatively low number of finds in the area from these periods.   There is a high potential for Post Medieval remains, as the land was a market gardens in the 18th Century, and was developed in the mid 19th Century.",A GIS polygon was drawn over the approximate area of the site.

Two trenches were opened which measured 24x4m.  A natural paleochannel was found, which is common in the lower lying areas of Southwark.   Cutting the natural clay were a series of densely packed series of pits and possible post holes. Thirteen features of Medieval age were recorded, and six were excavated. The fill of the pits indicated they were possibly cess pits. The prescience of Medieval features is somewhat surprising as the site is located away from the main Medieval settlement at Southwark.   Post Medieval remains included a Southwest-Northwest aligned channel .8m in depth and 3-4m wide. This channel follows the course of an earlier natural channel. The site was probably in rural use until the 19th Century.  Structural remains from the 19th Century were recorded in both trenches. The building was likely to have been bombed during the war, as it does not appear on post war maps. Also found was a flagstone surface and wells and soakaways from the 19th Century. Trench 2 contained features common in back gardens of houses, such as garden walls.    *Natural silty clay at between .87 and 1.21m OD",

These walls are part of Richmond Palace. Two sixteenth Century brick walls were cut by one later sixteenth Century brick wall. Another wall cut only one of the earlier walls. Two of the later walls were truncated by a cut feature filled with sand and gravel. This was later truncated by an eighteenth Century wall built out of re-used sixteenth Century brick. A chamber of brick with a vaulted roof was also thought to be eighteenth Century, as was a cess-pit of brick with a domed roof. A possible nineteenth Century garden feature of yellow brick was also found.",
