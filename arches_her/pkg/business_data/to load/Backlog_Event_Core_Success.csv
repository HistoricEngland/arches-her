The materials gathered and tested here have been compared to similar materials from other archaeological sites in the Mid-Saxon 'Lundenwic' period in the City of London. The National Portrait Gallery is located on St. Martin's Lane just south of Orange Street. The objective here was to observe the material used and then compare it to other sites including the Lyceum Theatre and the Royal Opera House where evidence of in situ Saxon wattle and daub walls have been found. Within the development area behind the National Portrait Gallery (still within the grounds) there are several pits that have been characterised for their use and it seems that they were excavated for the brickearth. More than 22kg of fired daub was recovered here mostly from two large rubbish pits. The resource is important because of the amount recovered fro a small site and its ability to be used for the study of source soils and building technologies. The report also contains examples from other sites in London (Lundenwic), information on wattle and daub construction experimentation and a structural analysis on the wattle and daub hut.",

Six test pits were excavated but only five were recorded. Three were examined in detail.  In test pit 1, natural brick earth was observed. Fragments of Tudor brick, Kentish ragstone and a sherd of Medieval green-glazed white ware were recovered.  In test pit 2 a rectangular feature with rounded corners was observed infer the modern tarmac. This is possibly a soak-away or cess pit. The feature was back-filled with demolition rubble and Post Medieval pottery and is thought to be associated with the Portuguese embassy or Catherine of Braganza's religious community.  In test pit 3, 2.20m below ground surface was a slab from an earlier basement. Directly beneath the slab was a layer of orange sandy clay, which sealed an orange-brown clay-gravel layer (probably a dump of material). The lowest layer recorded with a compact sandy-clay, thought to be disturbed natural. In test pit 4, the uppermost 1.2m had been disturbed by modern intrusions. Below this disturbance were three stratified deposits: a dark grey-brown-sandy-silty-clay with shell and charcoal inclusions, a black silty charcoal band (interpreted as residue from a hearth) and a compact  brown sandy-clay. These were above the natural brick earth.  In test pit 5 the top 1.20m comprised the present slab and its make up. Beneath this were two layers of brown sandy-clays with lenses of gravel. These are thought to be from an earlier phase of construction, associated with the brick floor underneath. These bricks are thought to post-date 1700.  The test pits revealed finds and archaeological features consistent with the known Medieval and Post Medieval activity on the site.

The site (at the time of the compilaiton of the report) was occupied by 20th Century buildings and derelict late1960/early 1970s fixed wharf crane.  It was concluded that there is a high potential for the alluvium and peat deposits to containg palaeoenvironmental remains, these would be of low or medium heritage significance. Additionally there is a high potential for buried footings of 18th and 19th Century warehouses and houses as well as an earlier Post Medieval river wall. There is also a low to moderate potential for remains of Prehistoric marshland exploitation within and beneath alluvium. There is a low potential for archaeological remains of all other periods.  A geoarchaeological deposit model was also created to support the historic environment assessment. It was concluded that there was substantial reclamation and ground consolidation in the later Medieval and Post Medieval periods, along with the deposition of thick alluvium, which buried the original low-lying floodplain gravels. Prehistoric occupation horizons may be found in the higher drier areas of Thames channel floodplains and organic deposits may preserve, including waterside structures, pollen and macro-botanicals. The alluvium and deeper organic fills may also preserve palaeoenvironmental material, enabling the reconstruction of the past landscape.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The site was considered to have a moderate potential for later Medieval remains. The site is included in the southern part of the local authority designated Area of Special Archaeological Significance, referring to the later Medieval settlement of Whetstone, and it is possible roadside buildings were located on the site, or that it was part of a later Medieval farming estate. Remains of agricultural soils or boundary ditches would be of low significance. The remains of any later Medieval building footings or foundations would be of medium to high significance. The site was considere to have a moderate potential for Post Medieval garden remains. From historic map evidence, it is likely that the site lay within undeveloped open gardens or farmland until the purchase of the land between the High Road and Dollis Brook by the Baxendale family in the 1820s. The site then lay within gardens until the construction of a nursery in the mid to late-19th Century. Garden soils or and/or the foundations of garden buildings or nurseries would be of low significance. The site has an uncertain but probably low potential for Prehistoric and Roman remains. The location of the site on boulder clay means it was unlikely to be favoured for settlement in the Prehistoric period. The site was peripheral to the primary centre of occupation in Londinium and the settlements within London's hinterland that developed along the road network.

Kensington Palace is a Grade I Scheduled Monument and a London Heritage Site.  Twelve trenches were excavated during the watching brief and six additional trees were installed at a later date. The trenches were excacated using a mechanical excavator and were excavated in 1m slots. Machining was conducted in 100mm spits until the top of the archaeological sequence or c.0.30m depth was reached. Excavation of horizontal stratigraphy or cut archaeological features was then continued by hand.  No archaeological remains pre-dating the Post Medieval period were discovered, partly due to the limited depth of the excavations. At the base of trenches 1-5 and 7 a layer of made ground (possibly redeposited brickearth) was observed. Withinn this layer, three pits were revealed, two undated, which are thought to have been earlier garden features. Additionally in trench 5 was a slay layer, overlying compacted rubble, dating to the late 19th Century. This may indicate furnace waste. A late 19th Century layer sealed the earlier features, possbily resulting from the destruction of the barracks and associated buildings.  At the junction of trenches 9 and 10 was intact brickwork in the form of an inspection chamber. This may have been for a culvert, indicated on a survey of 1754 og which only the cut and backfill is visible. The chamber may be a small square tank labelled on a plan from 1838.  The majority of modern disturbance was located in trench 12.  Many of the layers contained residual finds of an earlier date including black early pan glazed tiles, which may have originated from Nottingham House, the pre-cursor of Kensington Palace.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Three trenches were machine-excavated, each measuring 14-15m long and 1.8m wide.  In trench 1 the natural, orange brown sandy gravel, was recorded at 30.04m OD. This was overlain by a thick layer of compact dark grey silt, which is thought to have been imported onto the site.  In trench 2 the natural, orange brown sandy gravel, was recorded at 30.37m OD. This was partially cut by paving slabs covering a utilities pipe. The natural and slabs were sealed by a layer of redeposited material.  In trench 3 the natural, orange brown sandy gravel, was recorded at 29.32m OD. Overlying the natural was the foundations of a four course wall made of unmortared bricks. The wall extended for at least 7.7m within the trench aligned northeast to southwest. A return aligned northwest to southeast was located at the southwestern edge. The bricks are typical of the late 18th and early 19th Century. A bedding layer was located above the wall, onto which concrete had been lain.  It has been suggested that as cartographic sources indicate there was no development on the site prior to the late 19th Century, these bricks may have been reused or were wasters.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The historic building recording was carried out to Level 1-2 standard firstly in September 2015 and then following the removal of external scaffolding in July 2016. The building is a five-storey red brick Police Station with stone dressings and a two-storey cellblock to the rear. The Police Station and cellblock form a C-shape plan around a courtyard.  A photographic record was made of all elements that may be lost through conversion, renovation and demolition. The exterior is largely unaltered.  The watching brief was carried out in September and October 2015 during ground reduction of the external courtyard. Limited results of low significance were revealed. London Clay was revealed at 33.47m. A circular brick cistern 1.68m in diameter and c.2.00m deep was revealed. The bricks were 230mm by 101mm by 67mm and hand-fired, bonded with cement mortar. The cistern was almost fully backfilled with a mix of loose clayey silt, brick rubble, flowerpots, roof tiles and animal bone. This fill indicates a domestic source and probably relates to houses on the site in the 19th Century. The Clay and cistern were sealed by a layer (typically 0.50m deep, but with deeper patches of 1.60m deep) of mid brown clayey silt containing a high proportion of brick rubble, mortar and roof tile, likely representing the demolition horizon of buildings on the site before the police station was built. This layer was then sealed by 0.20m of hardcore with a tarmac surface.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The evaluation trench was located within an existing brick shed, due to be demolished and replaced by a new building. The shed lies within the moated area, close to the line of the moat.  An area of slab 4m by 2m was broken out and a trench measuring 3m by 2m by excavated with a small tracked machine. The whole area of the trench was reduced by 0.25m to expose the top of the archaeological deposits then a narrow trench 0.55m wide was excavated to a depth of 0.60m down the centre.  At 0.25m a compact grey silty-clay with inclusions of pebbles, roots, charcoal fleck, tile and greensand fragments was exposed. This was interpreted as Post Medieval dumping and material cleared from the moat. Within this deposit a brick floor was identified, along with a spread of mortar and greensand fragments which may have been part of a robbed vault.  An 18th Century ceramic field drain was identified cut into the base of the trench, 1.55m from the western end. This had cut through a circular brick well, possibly of 17th Century date.  At the eastern end of the trench a north-south brick footing was identified. This is provisionally dated to the 17th or 18th Century.  In the base of the central slit trench two deposits were identified. At the west end was a compact green-grey silty clay with charcoal, pebble and tile inclusions. The tile inclusions were dated to the late Medieval period. At the eastern end of the trench the deposit was more sandy and had a higher gravel content.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

An earlier evaluation in 1991 had revealed evidence of a late Iron Age settlement. The 1996 excavation was opened using a mechanical excavator.  The 1996 excavation recorded three semi-circular structures, one of which (structure 1), was first partly recorded in 1991. Structure 1 was a curvilinear slot. The fill contained charcoal, a small amount of burnt clay, burnt flint, bone, pottery and a loom weight fragment. Within the area enclosed by the slot, was a 'surface' of relatively densely packed pebbles. Structure 2 was a group of postholes, stratigraphically earlier than Structure 1. The postholes were arranged in an irregular arc, which was probably originally a circle measuring 12.5m in diameter. Structure 3 consisted of eight postholes/ small pits and one stakehole, which together formed a rough semi-circle. These three structures are interpreted as roundhouse type buildings. Structure 4 was a group of two sub-round postholes and two cigar-shaped features wee found, forming a rough rectangle. This has been interpreted as a variation on the 'classic' four-post structure often interpreted as a granary.  A number of pits and postholes were also found concentrated in the west and north of the site. Some of the stakeholes may have been the base of a wooden frame. The pits with postholes may have had a craft function, possibly as weaving pits for an upright loom. The distribution of pit types has been interpreted as the zoning of different activities.  These features, together with the finds from across the site, reveal evidence of human activity on and around the site from the Mesolithic until the Iron Age. It appears that semi-permanent or permanent structures were constructed during the late Iron Age. The settlement here may have acted as a satellite settlement of the enclosed settlement of Old Malden. The presence of the site suggests that later Prehistoric communities did not avoid the heavy soils of the London Clay as often thought.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Two trial trenches were excavated: Trench 1 was approximately 7.8m long, orientated WNW-ESE, by 1.90m NNE-SSW, while Trench 2 measured 7.22m long N-S by 1.92m E-W. Five test pits were also hand-dug in each trench to expose natural deposits.  Trench 1 was dug to a maximum depth of 750mm. Across the trench was a sequence of modern compact clinker and debris, followed by a compacted grey silty sand, which sealed a dark brown silty-sand, followed by a darker orange silty sand. The natural light orange silty-sand colluvium was first encountered at c.490mm below ground level in the NNE section of the trench.  In Trench 2 the natural light orange silty-sand colluvium was first encountered at c.520mm below ground level in the eastern section of the trench. Across the trench was a sequence of modern compact clinker and debris, which overlay a compacted mottled mid-grey-brown silty sand, over a light brown-orange silty sand.  The light orange silty sand colluvium overlay the underlying decayed/fragmented chalk solifluction deposit. This found in several test pits at a level of c.50.94m to 51.04m OD. A small assemblage of later Prehistoric struck flint was found within the reworked colluvium. This small quantity suggests that there was no sustained Prehistoric activity on the site. The only evidence for Roman activity was a sherd of Roman coarseware. A 12th-13th Century ceramic peg tile was found in the reworked colluvium in trench 2.

It was concluded that there is a very low potential for Prehistoric remains and a low potential for Roman finds, most likely in the form of quarry pits or dumps. There is low potential for Early Medieval remains and a moderate potential for Medieval remains. Medieval remains would most likely be in the form of dump material and quarry pits. There is a high potential for remains dating to the Post Medieval period, relating to two previous phases of construction on the site.

Towards the southern end of the site three ring gullies were found on a northeast-southwest alignment spaced c.4.50m apart. They were cut into the natural clay. The ring gully furthest to the northeast was truncated to the southeast by a modern soak away. The ring gullies to the northeast and southwest were similar in size and profile while the central ring gully was lightly larger in plan and had a square-cut profile opposed to a shallow concave profile.

In the absence of geotechnical data to confirm below ground conditions, it is anticipated that construction for the proposed basement level would impact buried alluvial deposits. Archaeological remains are considered likely to be of Local Significance. Archaeological remains from other periods are considered very unlikely. It is deemed unlikely that the development will cause significance harm to the historic environment.   It is recommended that geotechnical works are archaeologically monitored to confirm the below ground conditions and establish the presence / character of archaeological deposits (including environmental evidence, for example peat horizons).

The two trial trenches dug during the evaluation revealed Post Medieval strata associated with the manor. An excavation was subsequently undertaken from the 3rd April to 3rd May 1995 as a condition of planning consent for the proposed development. Archaeology works were restricted to areas that would be affected by the foundations of the new extension. 9 trenches were excavated and archaeological strata was found, which were generally buried beneath 0.5m to 0.7m of modern material. Archaeological evidence was uncovered for the Hounslow Priory, which historical sources suggest was in existence by c. 1200, and for the post- Dissolution manor. Remains relating to the religious house included strata dated to the 14th or 15th Century, and a ditch backfilled in the late 15th Century. A clay hearth also appeared to be contemporaneous with the priory, as did an overlying pitched tile hearth, although the latter could have been of post- Dissolution state. Evidence for the manor included deposits and features dating to the 17th and 18th Centuries, and a (1711) brick wall, which was part of the east wing of the manor house. The manor house was destroyed in the early 19th Century.",

In terms of designated heritage assets, no designated World Heritage Sites, Scheduled Monuments, Historic Wrecks or Historic Battlefields lie within, or in close proximity to, the study site. The site is located within the Lundenwic and The Strand Archaeological Priority Area as designated by the City of Westminster. The site is considered likely to have a moderate to high archaeological potential for remains associated with the Anglo-Saxon, Late Medieval and Post-Medieval periods at depth within the site, and a limited potential for all other periods. Occupation and garden activity during the Medieval and Post-Medieval periods is considered likely to have had a moderate widespread negative impact on below ground archaeological deposits. The construction of buildings on the site during the Post-Medieval period is considered likely to have had a widespread severe negative impact on below ground archaeological deposits due to the cutting of basements, foundations and services. The demolition of the Post-Medieval buildings, followed by the construction of the current development is considered likely to have had further cumulative severe widespread negative impact on below ground archaeological deposits due to the cutting of a double basement, foundations, and services. The development proposals comprise the reorganisation of the ground floor and basement layouts, plus part extensions to the building. The only intrusive works proposed is the localised reduction of floor levels and the excavation of a single lift pit. On the basis of the available information, and the localised character of the proposed development impacts, we recommend the implementation of a programme of archaeological evaluation.",

The natural gravels were overlain by layers of alluvium (likely to represent post-Mesolithic inundation of the area). The alluvium is up to 0.80m thick.  Cut features were recorded dating to the late 19th/20th Century. These may be the remains of large tree pits or the result of rubbish pits. No other archaeological finds or features were recorded.,A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Over Arup & Partners undertook an archaeological evaluation at 50 Triton Square between 12/05/95 and 14/05/95. This is in advance of the redevelopment of the site with the construction of a new commercial structure. Four machine dug trial pits were excavated under the supervision of an EH archaeology advisor. One hand dug trial pit was included for the recovery of soil samples for chemical contaminant testing. No soils or artefacts of archaeological interest were found during the evaluation and all pits contained 19th and 20th Century fill sitting on brickearth or gravel in situ soils. This fill was associated with the walls and foundations of an old school house and factory. Therefore it was concluded that the site had a low archaeological potential and no further formal archaeological interventions will be necessary.,

The evaluation helped to refine an initial assessment of the archaeological potential of the site which was carried out in the form of a desk based assessment earlier in 2002.  Four evaluation trenches were excavated between 02/12/2002 and 06/12/2002. Natural gravels and sands were recorded within each trench and vary from a height of 17.65m OD to 14.36m OD. Trench 1 (10m x 4m) contained fragments of 19th Century brick and was truncated by a 19th Century brick and mortar soak away or well. To the north of Trench 2 (18.35m x 4m) a natural channel was recorded. To the south natural deposits were truncated by a 19th or 20th Century brick drain and possible soak away or foundation. Modern drainage truncated most of the excavated area within Trench 3 (25m x 4m). The natural sands were truncated by a series of 19th or 20th Century pits within Trench 4 (6m x 4m).   The evaluation concludes that the survival of horizontal archaeological stratification on the site is limited as is the potential for the survival of cut features.

A Phase 1 evaluation (Trenches 1 and 2) was previously carried out in the north of the site by Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd under the same site code. Remains of the 19th Century ice house on the site were also recorded previously by Pre-Construct Archaeology Ltd (ABB11).   Three trenches (Trenches 3 to 5) were excavated on the site. Fluvial gravels were encountered in all trenches. The height variation suggests a very gentle slope from the road in the east down towards the River Roding in the west. No terrace gravels were encountered in either of the trenches, only a build up of natural fluvial deposits. The deposits represent the alternating fluvial activity associated with the river meandering in the vicinity of the site over millennia.  A number of large and irregular pit cuts of Medieval date, observed in Trenches 3 to 5, suggest that Medieval activity did spread south along Abbey Road, away from the focal point of the Abbey and Town Quay. The pits produced pottery dated to the 11th to 14th Century. The function of these pits is unknown.  A number of Post Medieval walls were identified in the evaluation which were related to industrial buildings which were present on the site during the 19th and 20th Centuries.

The earliest archaeology recorded on the site was Middle Saxon (at 5.25m OD) and consisted of pitting and levelling layers. This evidence confirms that there was a slope south of the Strand to the Middle Saxon waterfront. Material culture associated with these features reveal evidence for trade with North France/Belgian and textile production. There was also evidence for Middle Saxon diet. Similarly Medieval activity comprises levelling deposits and pitting, indicating that this area had not yet been built over. A number of chalk rubble cellar wall foundations were recorded, which predate the Tudor Palace of Somerset House. These foundations have late Medieval and early Post Medieval mortar types. These are thought to relate to Chester Inn and its associated buildings. The remains of the Tudor Duke of Somerset's palace, largely constructed 1547-53, were also uncovered. These relate to the cellars under the southern range of the Lower Court. The majority of the walls recorded were of red brick faces with Kentish ragstone ashlars and mouldings. An assemblage of moulded stone was also recovered and provides evidence of the appearance of windows and doors. In the Stuart period it appears that Tudor masonry was reused as garden walls. Associated with the extant building were a series of levelling deposits and remnants of an original brick-paved basement floor surface and hearth. There was also an extensive network of drainage culverts below the basement floor.  These appear  to have been disused by the mid-19th Century, based on a small assemblage of mid-19th Century pottery. In the late 19th Century a network of brick and tile-lined flues were constructed.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The watching brief was carried out in association with the installation of two pop-up power sockets in the Kitchen Garden at Hampton Court Palace, Surrey. Their installation required the excavation of two trenches in the central western compartment of the former Tudor Tiltyard. The trenches measured 0.7m x 0.8m with a depth of up to 1.2m. Trench I was located in the south-eastern corner of this compartment adjacent to the southern entrance.  Trench II was located in the centre.  The area has been explored archaeologically over the last few years, there nevertheless remained the possibility of observing archaeological deposits, layers and particularly garden features associated with the post-Tudor phases. The only archaeologically significant feature appeared near the base of the east-facing section and part of the north-facing section of Trench I. This layer of crushed CBM (ceramic building material) and mortar was likely the remains of an early pathway running along the eastern perimeter of this central western compartment of the former Tiltyard related to the 19th Century Kitchen Garden.

Three evaluation trenches were excavated (c. 15m by 1.8m) to a depth of approx. 1.2m. The trenches were excavated by machine and monitored by a Museum of London Archaeology supervisor.  In Trench 1 the natural was a friable mid orange-brown silty sand with frwquent flinty gravel and was located at 1.20m below the present ground surface. The natural was then overlain by make up deposits of dark grey-brown sandy silt. These were then overlain by garden soil.  In Trench 2 the natural comprised a friable light yellow-orange clayey sand and was located at approx. 1.10m below current ground level. This was overlain by a make up layer. A pit had been cut into the make up layer to a depth of 1.40m below current ground surface and a dark deposit had been dumped within. This was overlain by a garden soil.  In Trench 3 the natural comprised light yellow-orange sandy clay with gravel and was located at a depth of 1m below present ground surface. This was overlain by a mixed layer of redeposited natural sand and clay, which contained fragments of modern brick and concrete. This was overlain by a garden soil.

The archaeological investigations have recorded some structural remains, possibly dating from the Early Medieval or Saxon period, and waste material suggesting woodworking in the vicinity. An Evaluation was completed at the site in two phases (November 2016 and February 2017). Following the evaluation fieldwork a watching brief was subsequently conducted to monitor ground works which had the potential to impact archaeological deposits. This included clearance of foundations and enabling works associated with the installation of the piling mat, as well as excavations associated with the construction of a crane base and two lift pits. Within the Lift Pit 1 area Firm greenish grey clay was recorded at c 1.60m OD and continued to the limit of excavation. This deposit was overlain by a c 200mm thick layer of gravelly sand. The clay deposit contained one fragment of CBM and the sand deposit  contained occasional worked wood fragments at its base. Three vertical oak stakes were found on the east edge of an area of general ground reduction excavations. These stakes appear overlain by sandy gravel deposit and driven through clay.  The stratigraphic sequence observed in Area 1 (ELO18391) continued in the Lift Pit 2  area. There were a number of deep modern truncations, as well as hydrocarbon contaminants, in this area. No additional archaeological remains were observed.  In the Crane base area, as was seen in Areas 2 and 3 (ELO18575) , natural sandy gravel (Kempton Park gravel), was found at c 0.9-1m OD. Modern intrusions had truncated much of this area down to c 1.3-1.4m OD. However, the archaeological sequence survived to a higher level on the east side of the crane base area, where the untruncated deposits survived up to c 2.35m OD. A squared, radially cleft timber measuring 200mm x 170mm x 1.05m long was recoded as well as ten assorted blue black timbers that were seen lying horizontally in the base of gravelly sand overlying clay. Their colour suggests they were probably of oak and looked like they may have included both roundwood and cleft items.",

Within 250m of the site, it was found that there were remains from the Prehistoric period onwards. Historic maps revealed that the site was undeveloped until 1866, when a building was constructed in the south-west of the site, with associated hardstanding. By the 1890s, most of the site held a starch manufactory and the south-west contained terraced residential houses. From the late 1940s the site was a tin box factory and a laboratory was located on the site from the early 1970s. These buildings had been cleared by 2008. A ground investigation was conducted on the site. 3 boreholes, 5 test pits and 6 window samples were used to investigate the site. It was found that there is a depth of between 1.25m and 2.7m of made ground below the present ground surface. The closest the depth of the natural Kempton Gravels is to the ground surface is 1.1m. This suggests that elsewhere on the site there has been truncation of the natural gravels.

The Queen's House, Tower of London, is an ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬Ãƒâ€¹Ã…â€œL'-shaped building built along the southern and western walls of Tower Green. It is the most important example of domestic timber-framing to survive in London. The south range consists of four N-S bays fronting with gables onto Tower Green, the southern half of the eastern two bays being combined to form a kitchen with smoke-blackened roof running parallel to the south wall. To the west of this in the third, slightly enlarged bay is the Council Chamber. This originally served as a great hall, which was floored over early in the 17th Century (timbers not accessible). The west range is aligned with the circa 1200 defensive walls against which it is built and consists of four jettied faÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ade gables above two further jetties below facing onto Tower Green. These gables were also sampled and together with the main N-S range producing six precise felling dates of winter 1538/9, and the south E-W range producing seven precise felling dates of winter 1538/9 and another seven dates of spring 1539. This suggests that construction might have commenced with the north-west range in 1539, and immediately continued with the south range. It had been suggested that the south range roofs had been constructed at different dates, but the dendro is supported by the carpentry with includes extended tiebeams jointed at each bay line. Other important features include original carved barge boards and depressed four-centre heads in the windows, along with ogee bracing The Bell Tower in the corner of the two ranges dates from circa 1200, but no timber survives from this period. The replacement conical roof is of pine construction, although samples from this failed to date. However, joists from the staircase turret on the NE side of the bell tower replaced during repair works in 2015 did date, one retaining complete sapwood and dating to 1750/51.

Recent archaeological training excavations by Hendon & District Archaeological Society on the site have produced Roman pottery, Saxon/Early Medieval pottery, Medieval and Post Medieval pottery. Most of these pieces are small and abraded and are interpreted as being material transported to the site through hill wash from settlement further upslope and/or long-term manuring and plough action.  It is thought that the application site remained wooded during the Prehistoric period. It is thought that the site remained as wither woodland or farmland until the 16th Century when Hendon House was built and the land was incorporated into gardens and parkland for the house. The ground was subsequently levelled as a school playing field in the late 1920s. It is concluded that there is a low potential for encountering significant archaeological deposits relating to early or later Medieval settlement and a negligible potential for encountering remains from other periods. It is thought that long term ploughing, playing field levelling and horticultural activity will have had a significant negative impact on any surviving archaeological remains.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

In trench 4, a deep cut feature (measuring approximately 0.6m deep), cut into the natural and containing small pieces of Post Medieval CBM, was found. This is thought to be evidence of quarrying on the site in the Post Medieval period.  Apart from a small section of wall in the northern part of the site, there was no archaeological evidence for the buildings associated with the garage and nursery shown on maps of the site in the 19th and 20th Centuries.

The site works within MO121 were limited to the monitoring of service trenches. A single service trench was monitored measuring 59.70m in length by 6.00m wide.  Natural alluvial deposits were encountered in two areas of the site varying between 7.00m and 3.5m below current ground level. The variation was due to previous structures truncating the alluvial horizon.

The report was requested by the local planning authority in order to supply sufficient information for an appropriate mitigation strategy to be formulated in light of the proposed development. The evaluation was commissioned from by C&A Design on behalf of the client ASDA Stores. The evaluation was undertaken in June, 2015, and comprised the excavation of two trenches. The trenches revealed natural sand and gravel at 0.60-0.72m OD, overlaid by a natural deposit of very sandy clay at 0.86-1.01m OD. Although previously excavations on the nearby B&Q site had revealed dense scatters of Mesolithic flint at this level, no Prehistoric worked flints were found during this investigation A shallow ditch on a north-south alignment cut the sandy clay, and was covered by what was probably a subsoil horizon comprising silty clay. Both were undated, but were probably of Prehistoric date. It is argued here, from its orientation and the nature of its fill, that ditch might date to either the Middle-Late Bronze Age or the Late Iron Age. The subsoil was cut by Post Medieval features, all of which were probably of 19th Century date. Some contained sherds of white-glazed pottery and/or fragments yellow London Stock brick. They comprised a crudely built brick-lined manhole, pits and other indeterminate cut features. The results of the field evaluation have helped to refine the initial assessment of the archaeological potential of the site. They suggest that there is high potential for localised survival of subsoil horizons and at least occasional underlying features, as well as late  Post Medieval features. The proposed development would comprise the construction of an automated three-pump petrol filling station with two c 15.0m long by c 3.0m wide buried fuel storage tanks in the south-eastern part of the existing supermarket car park. The main impact of the scheme would result from the construction of a new strengthened slab for the petrol station forecourt, and localised deep excavations for underground tanks. Given the archaeological potential of the site, indicated by previous investigations in the locality and the results of the evaluation, the local planning authority is likely require an archaeological watching brief to be undertaken in order to mitigate the impact of the proposed development.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

It was concluded that there was moderate potential for the footings of Post Medieval buildings. There is a low to moderate potential for later Medieval settlement on the site. Any remains of buildings dating to this period would be of medium significance. By 1746 (Rocque's Map) small buildings may have extended into the western part of the site while the eastern part was an orchard. In 1809 two buildings are seen within the site. By 1875 these have extended to the north of the site; possibly these buildings represent a house with a large service wing to the east. There were landscaped gardens to the south of the house with four small glasshouses in the centre. The site had begun to be cleared by 1895 and by 1913 the current building could be seen in the southern part of the site. It had occupied its current footprint by 1952.  There is low potential for buried heritage assets of other periods. It is estimated that  the top of untruncated Clay lies at 29.4 OD. The shallow depth of the natural geology suggests that any archaeological remains are likley to have been severely truncated or removed from within the footprint of the exisiting building. Survival is likely to be high in the back garden.,A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The main research objective of the excavations were to obtain information about the ground plan and structural history of the abbey church, identified through a Time Team investigation in 2003. The excavations exposed archaeological remains including: robbed foundations of the church, sections of wall, structures within the church (including bases for piers)m, brick lined graves, funerary monuments, the remains of abbey buildings, burials and post-dissolution garden features. The excavations succeeded in revealing evidence for the Medieval abbey and post-Dissolution formal gardens at a site of national importance. It was revealed that the church at Syon was wider than Bridgettine churches at Mariager, Denmark, Vadstena, Sweden and Pirita Abbey, Estonia. Evidence also suggests that several surviving structures in and around Syon House may have originally formed part of the abbey, indicating that not all of the structures were removed following dissolution. It was found that within the north and south aisles, double rows of brick graves were all built at the same time soon after the initial construction of the church. Once the thirty tombs had been filled, the earliest burial would be moved to make space for the next burial and so on. Abbey buildings to the south and north of the church would have served strictly segregated communities of sisters and brothers.

The pit's fills indicated a late 17th Century date, suggesting the pit was excavated soon after the backfilling of the defences.  In Trench 3 a third probable Civil War Feature was recorded: a steep-sided linear feature with smaller linear features cut into the base. This is possibly a communication line running into the defences. The small linear features may be wheel ruts from vehicles travelling along the trench.  In the north west of the site (Trench 1), outside of the Civil War defensive line, further late 17th Century deposits suggests that activity occurred beyond as well as inside the defences. The make-up deposits were directly overlain by 20th Century foundations, walls and successive concrete floors.  Due to the lack of 18th and 19th Century deposits in Trench 2 and 3, it is thought that the site was occupied by a building. This is confirmed by historic mapping.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The site is considered  to have a high archaeological potential for Medieval and Post Medieval remains, a moderate potential for Late Prehistoric, Roman and palaeoenvironmental evidence and a low potential for Early Prehistoric remains.  For the Late Prehistoric period, nearby investigations have revealed evidence of occupation including ditches, post holes and pits. Furthermore the peat deposits were located on the site. There is also evidence for Late Iron Age/Roman activity adjacent to the site, including settlement and quarrying activity. This activity appears to be centred in alluvial deposits overlying higher areas of gravel, suggesting the highest potential for these remains will be in the south-eastern part of the site.  During the Medieval period the site was located close to the centre of a settlement, meaning there is high potential for settlement evidence along the eastern boundary of the site. This remained the case throughout the Post Medieval period. The 1834 map of the Rainham Levels indicates the presence of several small enclosures and buildings on the site, one of which was a Chapel.

It is anticipated that any unknown archaeological remains still present within the site are of no more than local significance. Archaeological remains, if present would be buried at depths beneath modern made gravel and alluvium. Excavations for services and foundations will unlikely impact below the made ground and recent alluvium. Piling and basement construction will possibly impact archaeological horizons however in view of the size of development footprint and the low density pile design.

The geotechnical investigations consisted of three boreholes, eight window samples and four test-pits.  The results of these investigations found that London Clay lay at between 3.3 and 4.2m bgl (ca. 25.5m OD). The London Clay was overlain by sands and sub-angular to sub-rounded flint gravel <10cm in diameter, representative of Kempton Park Terrace. These gravels were capped and/or truncated by Made Ground to the present day surface. In TP101 and BH101 a horizon of orange or borwn silty clay was recorded, possibly representing Langley Silt. This deposit showed digns of contamination/reworking.  The Kempton Park Gravel has minimal potential for recovery of artefact remains and no organic-rich material was recorded with palaeoenvironmental potential. The Langley Silt was also thought to not be conducive to recovery of archaeological remains.  No further work was recommended as a result.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

This involved monitoring six service investigation pits as part of a programme of monitoring water pipes. The pits were variable in size. A sequence of deposits was recorded in five of the six pits. The earliest deposit identified was an undisturbed soil horizon in Pit 5 and a possible alluvial deposit in Pits 4 (1.58m AOD) and 7 (1m AOD). These deposits were only partially revealed. Pottery recovered from the alluvial deposit in Pit 7 dates to the 13th or 14th Century. Over these deposits was varying depth of made ground. This had been heavily disturbed by the insertion of services in the late Post Medieval and modern periods. Pottery and clay pipe assemblages suggest they were deposited in the 18th and 19th Centuries.  Stock brick built masonry features were present in Investigation Pits 2 and 3.

The earliest identified material was residual Prehistoric pottery and worked flint of either Early Neolithic or Late Bronze Age date indicating some Prehistoric activity within the area. Residual Roman material was also found.  The most significant period of activity dated to the Middle Saxon period at a time when the site is understood to have lain on the periphery of the settlement of Lundenwic. The evidence primarily comprised gravel quarrying apparently within an area demarcated by ditches during the later 8th and early 9th Centuries. The earliest phase was marked by generally shallower quarry pits partially enclosed by a ditch, with the fills of this phase containing a notable lack of finds. The second phase of Saxon quarry activity comprised notably deeper pits containing more finds. The quarrying was enclosed by a large ditch, the size of which might suggest that it formed part of the defences of Lundenwic. Some refuse deposition was also noted during this phase; this expanded during the mid-9th Century when a significant amount of refuse material was used to backfill earlier features. Purpose built rubbish pits were also dug along with a possible industrial feature lined with mortar. Early and mid-17th Century activity primarily comprised quarrying, the backfilling of quarry pits and refuse dumping. The late 17th and 18th Centuries saw the development of small terraced housing along either side of St Thomas's Street; later called King Street, a street that formerly bisected the site. Significant horizontal truncation during the construction of Parker House, which followed the clearance of the area in the later 19th Century, meant that only occasional foundations of this housing, and cut features such as cess pits and soakaways survived.",

The data collected has identified several positive linear  responses associated with former cut features, which may be of archaeological interest,  however a different origin should not be discounted.  Modern activity on the site is evident through a complex arrangement of land drains and two  modern services crossing the site. Also noted are a number of responses associated with the  sports equipment present within the survey area.  The magnetic 'spikes' indicative of ferrous materials have been interrogated in greater depth  to assess if they are potentially associated with unexploded ordnance. These responses have  been categorised into three groups, those likely to be associated with ferrous debris generally  too small or weak in amplitude to be associated with UXO's, those which can be attributed to  sports posts present on site and finally those which may be associated with UXO. These  responses have been identified as large ferrous objects however due to the limitations of the  methodology, no further information can be provided regarding size, depth or possible cause.

These investigations comprised the monitoring of drainage works, pile probing and pile augering and the excavation of a single trench for the installation of a combined water pump and rising main. The excavation area measured 3.00m N/S by 3.20m E/W and was excavated to a depth of 4.12m bg. (ground level= c.14.3 to 14.4m OD). This area was extended 2.20m northwards.  In the excavation area, truncated natural gravel deposits were recorded at 10.29m OD and were recorded at similar heights during the works monitoring. Redeposited brick earth was recorded overlying the gravels at 10.98m OD. This contained some abraded Roman pottery sheds and ceramic building material fragments. It is possible the truncation of the natural was caused by features such as quarry pits, possibly of Roman date. Between 11.92m and 12.05m OD were probable garden soils, thought to be associated with the precinct of the Medieval Priory and Hospital of St Mary Spital. These soils contained sherds of Medieval pottery dating to the 13th and 14th Centuries. Above this was a sequence of deposits, between 12.71m OD and 12.90m OD, containing finds dated to between the 17th and early 18th Century.

Six archaeological evaluation trenches were excavated. Each measured 20m x 1.8m. The trenches were sited to avoid areas likely to have been disturbed by the construction of various hospital buildings. Excavation was undertaken in spits of no more than 0.10m to the top of the underlying natural substrate.   The natural Taplow Gravels were recorded at 6m OD in the southeast corner of the site (Trench 6), 5.76m OD in the northeast (Trench 2) and 5.60m OD in the west (Trench 1). They were recorded at a minimum height of 4.90m OD in Trench 3.  The earliest archaeological activity recorded on the site dates to the 18th-19th Century. Features dating to this period include a small pit and north-south aligned field boundary ditch in Trench 5 (this corresponds to a boundary seen on the 1869 Ordnance Survey Map). There is very little evidence (except residual remains) for activity prior to the 19th Century and the construction of the hospital. Prior to this, the site was within open fields. In the later 19th Century there was a probable gravel quarry, which had been infilled during the construction of the hospital.  There was approximately 1.60m of 19th-20th Century made ground across the site. There were also no intact soil horizons in any of the trenches. Both of these features indicate a certain degree of horizontal truncation across the site.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

It was suggested that there is a high potential for Prehistoric archaeological remains on the site as the site is above the Guy's channel, which is a watercourse known to contain deposits od Prehistoric date.  It was also suggested that there is a very high potential for Roman remains on the site. There is likely to evidence of Roman activity associated with the channel and channel frontage. In the later Roman period the site would have been above an area of high ground (after the channel infilled) and would have been suitable for development and occupation.  There is a low to moderate potential for Saxon archaeological remains. The area is not thought to have been occupied during this period however there may be some evidence of activity relating to the Late Saxon burh of Southwark located around the bridgehead.  Similarly the site was located beyond the main area of settlement during the early part of the Medieval period. The settlement expanded in the later Medieval period (as can been seen on the other side of St Thomas Street) so it is possible that there was some Medieval occupation on the site during this period. There is thought to be a high potential for Post Medieval archaeological remains on the site. The land the site occupies was developed during this period with Morgan's map of 1682 showing the site occupied by lanes, buildings and open spaces. By Rocque's map of 1746 the site had been redeveloped as the eastern wing of Guy's hospital. This wing was significantly damaged during World War II bombing. A building was constructed in the eastern part of the site by 1950 and had been removed by 1962. Boland house had been constructed by 1971. The nature of any possible 20th Century basements is unknown but these may have impacted upper archaeological horizons.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The earliest archaeological feature recorded was the top of a vaulted cellar, most probably contemporaneous with the construction of the houses above in the 1830s. This was overlain by a variety of levelling dumps which were possibly up cast from the excavation of the vault and used to level the ground above it.  The rear wall of the cellar was exposed along the north-eastern side of the site. A further sub-surface vaulted structure constructed of yellow and orange bricks was exposed, which dated probably to the 19th-20th Century. In the south-west corner of the site, a 19th-20th Century a square brick lined pit with rounded corners were found. This probably had a drainage function or may have been used as a water tank.

London. SE 17. The report was commissioned from Museum of London Archaeology Service by CgMs Consulting on behalf of the client Mount Anvil Construction Limited. Five evaluation trenches were excavated within the site to evaluate the site in general and also to determine the presence or absence of Roman activity in light of previous results of excavations at 82-96 Old Kent Road, to the immediate east of the site.  The earliest deposits present were natural sandy gravels, recorded at heights of 1.76m OD in Trench 3, sloping down to 0.50m OD in trench 4 to the north. These gravels represent the Pleistocene gravel terraces of the former floodplnins of the River Thames. In trench 4 a 0.35m thick deposit of tufa banded with silty clay and clayey silt was recorded at a height of 0.86m OD. These calcium deposits recorded on the site may represent carbonate/calci um enriched estuarine channels running across the area of the site.  The deposits observed during the evaluation indicate the presence of Roman activity on the site in the form of a Roman ditch recorded in Trench 1 and Roman pottery sherds recovered from subsoil deposits in trenches 2 and 4. No Medieval activity was recorded on the site, the presence of Post Medieval activity on the site was recorded in all five trenches. This activity was represented by either agriculturallhorticultural deposits dating to the Post Medieval period or levelling layers associated with the development of Post Medieval housing on the site. In trench 4, a N/E by S/W running possible ditch cut [35] was recorded along the eastern edge of the trench. The primary fill [34] of this feature contained pottery sherds and clay pipe fragments dating from 1660-1680",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The boreholes revealed the ground surface of the early to mid-Holocene. This found that the area was low lying and unsuitable for settlement in prehistory. Organic sediments were 1m deep and wree 3m below made up ground and the present day ground surface. The Lambeth Group strata revealed have no archaeological or palaeoenvironmental significance. The Lea Valley Gravel Member has low archaeological potential. The overlying deposits of fine grained alluvium also has low archaeological potential and probably low palaeoenvironmental potential due to oxidation of the upper part of the sequence.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Two evaluation trenches were excavated, with the concrete slab broken out and cleared by contractors under Museum of London Archaeology Service supervision. The trenches were excavated by machine.  In trench 1 natural was observed at 1.74m OD and comprised an orange sandy clay underneath a mid orange layer of charcoal and sandy clay thought to represent the natural alluvium. Above this was a light orangey brown alluvium, which faded to a bluish orange. Above this was a layer interpreted as a Post Medieval dump, no earlier in date than the late 16th Century. Above this was another Post Medieval dump/ alluvial/ make up layer. This was overlain by a slightly later Post Medieval dump layer. The last layer was a modern demolition later. The archaeology and natural was truncated at the southern end of the trench by modern demolition and cuts for modern pipes. Three masonry structures were identified in the eastern section of the trench and have been identified as 19th Century dwellings or outbuildings. In trench 2 the natural was observed at 1.40m OD and consisted of a light yellow orange sandy gravel beneath a compact mid orange natural sandy clay with pebbles. This was overlain by the same alluvium as in trench 1. Above this was a greyish light brown sandy clay containing pottery dating to between 1810 and 1840. This is thought to represent dumping or ground makeup. Modern demolition truncated the trench to the north and south of the deposits described.  It was concluded that the majority of the site had been heavily disturbed by modern development and there is limited archaeological survival on site. It is thought Roman, Prehistoric and Medieval deposits have been removed.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The excavated areas were reduced using a mechanical excavator under archaeological supervision. The dark earth layer capping the Roman horizons was stripped by hand in spits and systematically metal detected to procude a broad chronological sequence.  The excavation revealed how the site had been intensely occupied from the late 1st Century AD until present day with the exception of the immediate post-Roman period. Roman buildings of clay and timber would have extended over the site in late 1st and early 2nd Century and the site continued to be used into the late 4th or early 5th Century (based on the  presence of late Roman deep cut features such as timber lined wells and recovery of a large assemblage of late Roman coins.  The site was  possibly reoccupied by the mid 11th Century. A Papal Bulla was recovered from the 'dark earth horizon' below the later Medieval alleyway which became Nag's Head Yard. This bore the name of Innocent III who was in office from January 1198 to July 1216. The density of meieval rubbish pits and rich finds assemblages within illustrates the intensity of urban renewal in the site. A high proportion of vessels associated with serving frinks were recovered from the pottery assemblage suggesting inns had become a dominant feature of the Borough High Street landscape by the late 13th Century.  The area of the street frontage has been impacted by later basements meaning there is little evidence of Medieval occupation there. Later Medieval chalk and stone foundations, probably constructed in the late 14th and 15th centuies extended across large areas of the site, particularly in the southern and eastern sides. It was revealed that in the late Medieval period Nag's Head Yard did not cross the entire area.  Cesspits associated with the Medieval buildings continued into use to the late 15th and 16th Centuries. During this period new brick basements were constructed and previously open ground was built on, indicating that space was at a premium.  There was frequent rebuilding and remodeling of the exisitng ground plans during the 17th and 18th Centuries. This was followed by more comprehensive redevelopment in the late 18th or 19th Centuries.  An air raid defence tunnel was constructed in 1940, with its entrance located in the southwest corner of the site.

Trench C was also extended to the west to examine more of the waterfront. Over 30 metres of timber waterfront was recorded. Subsequently Trenches D and E were excavated.  The excavation revealed how the Romano-British canalised the watercourse in the second and third Centuries and erected a sophisticated waterfront structure along the western bank.

The evaluation and subsequent excavation revealed cut consisting of an extensive Late Bronze Age ditch system that probably formed an enclosure, pits and postholes. A pit cut into the enclosure ditch contained semi-articulated human bones that may represent ritual deposition or an inhumation burial (the skeleton was incomplete), these have been radiocarbon dated to c. 925BC. Struck flints have been dated to the Upper Palaeolithic to the Late Bronze Age or even Iron Age, though much of this material was residual.

The ruined Royal Garrison Church of St George is Grade II Listed. It was built in 1863 to the designs of T H Wyatt. It was bombed in World War II and is now roofless and fragmentary. Archaeological works were carried out in three phases. In April 2014, a trial trench against the outside of the south wall of the Nave was monitored (ELO14036). Further watching brief visits were undertaken in December 2014 during the excavation of eight square pile foundation pits (ELO16303) and in January 2015 during the excavation of a storm water drain trench. The second phase of the wathing brief closely monitored the machine excavation of eight square foundation pile pits (A1 to D2). The pits were 2.2m square with an average depth of 1.8m below the current ground level. Each was connected by a continuous trench for the concrete ring beam, which was 1.2m in depth. The natural geology was observed at a depth of 1.64m below the current ground level in Pile Foundation Pit B2, at a depth of 1.52m in Pile Foundation Pit C2, and at 1.6m in Pile Foundation Pit D1.  A 13th/14th Century tile-built kiln was recorded. The kiln, as well as a nearby pit and another tile-built structure all contained fragments of green-glazed London-type ware pottery in both its decorated and undecorated forms. By inference it is likely that the kiln was one of the few known centres for the production for this type of pottery making it a discovery of local importance. A church room was added to the north of the church in 1902 and 1903. Remains of walls found during the watching brief were from this building and an extension to it.

It seems likely this was constructed sometime between the mid-16th to early 17th Century. A major phase of rebuilding occurred in the later 17th Century, and increased the height of the structure to its present height, a total rebuild of the western wall and the construction of a timber roof. Further modifications included the construction of a brick floor, French drain, four exterior butreses. Around 1769 floors and a new roof were added, and the nesting holes on the lower two storeys blocked up, and the lower storeys converted to rooms.

The site was at Abbey Street. The archaeological investigation was undertaken between the 5th of July and the 8th of September 2011.  Following the removal of a modern concrete foundations, the modern made ground was carefully removed in 30mm spits under archaeological supervision using a toothless ditching bucket. Seven trenches were then excavated (trenches 3-9) within the footprint of the demolished Abbey Street Children's Home.   Trench 3 measured 14.30m north-south by 22.90m east-west, Trench 4 measured 1.90m north-south by 2.30m east-west, Trench 5 measured 2.10m North-south by 2.10m east-west, Trench 6 measured 1.65m north-south by 3.20m east-west,  Trench 7 measured 1.5m north-south by 2.48m east-west, Trench 8 measured 17.9m north-south by 21.80m east-west, and Trench 9 measured 2.90m north-south by 3.80m east-west. The earliest deposit encountered was a mid-light orangey yellow, gravely sand. In trench 3 it was encountered between a maximum lvel of 1.95 OD and a minimum level of 1.46m OD. The maximum level of natural in trenches 4,5,6,7 was at 2.36m OD in Trench 5 and the miminum level was 2.13OD in Trench 7. In Trench 8 the natural gravelly sand was recorded at 2.07m OD and 1.03m OD.  The natural sand was sealed by a sub-soil interpreted as a Roman horizon. This was sealed by deposits probably farmed during the Saxon period. This was largely truncated by modern activity and was best preserved in the southeast corner of Trench 8. These soils were probab;y still being worked at the time of the establishment of the Cluniac level in the late 11th Century.  The earliest Medieval occupation is represented n a ditch aligned north/south, which runs alongside the western edge of the site. This is interpreted as a boundary. This ditch was later truncated by a northeast-southwest orientated stone-built drain, which was later connected to an east/west orientated ditch/drain.  Contemporary with the stone-built drain were substantial chalk foundations bonded with brown sandy mortar found in the west area of the study site. This is interpreted as a 12th Century chancel. The 12th Century chancel was replaced in the 13th Century by massive ragstone foundations.  A well was constructed over the external side of the northeast corner of the chancel foundation during the Post Medieval period. This was probably built after AD1650.  Most of the Post Medieval archaeological deposits and structures were removed during the 1980's excavation.",

Two trenches were opened, one (Trench A) as far south as possible in an attempt to pick up the precinct wall of Bermondsey Abbey and the other (Trench B) as far east as possible to try and locate the Abbey grange. Trench A was approximately 17m north-south by 4m east-west and Trench B was 17m north-south by 7m east-west.   Concrete slab and obstructions were removed and the trenches udg to the level of top of natural (c. 1.78m OD). They were then scraped clean using the maching with a blade attachment to the bucket. Hand-cleaning with trowels and shovels was then utilised to locate features cut into the natural sands and gravels.  The excavation revealed evidence for fairly extensive and early (Late Iron-Age) settlement with potential for traces of earlier settlement (flint tools found in Trench A). Shall-tempered, coarse pottery is rarely found in Southwark but as similar pieces were found on Alaska Works, possibly this relates to local production continuing into the beginning of the Roman period.   Four parallel ""ditches"" found in Trench B may be indications of 2nd to 3rd Century horticultural activity. Roman tile and a piece of hypocaust tile excavated from the fills may suggest that there was a neighbouring villa or farmstead. Pottery from the fills ranged from local ware to fine table wares imported from abroad.  The only Medieval features were represented by a few sherds of Medieval pottery lying unstratified in the plough soil.  A large, rectangular horn-core lined pit measuring 2.40m by 2.20m and 0.54m deep cut through shallow Roman features (Cut 49 and 51).

The site, which is largely vacant, is considered for mixed-use redevelopment. The site is located within an Archaeological Priority Area which highlights the potential for the presence of archaeological remains. The site is underlain by alluvial deposits associated with the River Lea floodplains and there is the potential for archaeological and palaeoenvironmental evidence to survive within the alluvium. The potential for the presence of Romano-British remains is considered especially high as evidence for ground consolidation and timber structures has been revealed immediately to the south. There is a low potential for the remains of significant Medieval settlement and industrial activity within the site as from the post-Roman period until the 19th Century, this site would have been located within marshland. However, the presence of remains associated with the river management of Medieval and later date cannot be ruled out. The site was developed in the modern period, with the construction of the gas purification works in the 1898 and further factory buildings and residential properties in the early 20th Century. These buildings were demolished in the late 20th and early 21st Century. Buried remains associated with these structures are likely to be present within the site. The remains associated with the late 19th and early 20th Century industry may hold evidential values that could contribute to the understanding of the industrial heritage on Fish Island. Overall, this assessment has identified no heritage constraints that would preclude development within the site. The proposed development is not considered to conflict with national or local planning policy relating to the protection of the historic environment. It is considered that the disturbance to or loss of archaeological remains due to the proposed development could be satisfactorily mitigated through a programme of archaeological investigations at an appropriate stage of the development. Further archaeological works and mitigation could be secured through a condition attached to any permission granted.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The statement assesses the likely significant effects of the Development on the archaeological (below ground heritage asset) resource within the Site. Heritage assets identified within the Site include the Mill Pond and the Silk Mill path, although these are considered to be of negligible heritage significance (due to recorded truncation and disturbance within the Site) and have not been designated for protection. The archaeological potential of the Site has also been recognised through its incorporation within the Lewisham and Catford/Rushey Green Archaeological Priority Zone. However, the results of recent investigations within the Site have concluded that there is a limited potential for the survival of archaeological remains which would merit consideration in the planning process within the Site due to extensive truncation. Similarly, there is a low potential for paleo-environmental information to be present on the Site. Given this, the Site preparation and construction works would not likely cause harm to the archaeological resource.  A geoarchaeological survey (ARCA, November 2016) has already been undertaken on the Site and thus further mitigation measures are not considered necessary for this Development. Natural geology was observed during these works - the White Chalk Subgroup bedrock sub-cropped between +0.55m OD and +8.75m OD. The Kempton Park Gravel Member was determined to subcrop at between +6.49m OD and +4.29m OD. The Gravel is confined to the southern half of the site where it occupies an ancient channel of the River Ravensbourne. ARCA concluded that the deposits on the site had a low archaeological and palaeoenvironmental potential and recommended that no further work was required. The Site preparation and construction of the Development would have limited effects on townscape, heritage and views, except for one non-designated heritage asset (Eagle House), and one townscape heritage area (Lewisham Character Area), where there would be a minor adverse effect. Once completed, the Development provides a demonstrable positive effect to the function and appearance of the townscape.",

The evaluation was commissioned in advance of proposed development of the site for residential use.  The site fronts the eastern side of North Street to the immediate south of King's Road.   The site lies within the northern part of the historic core of the settlement of Barking, which developed as an adjunct to Barking Abbey. Barking developed on the navigable river Roding, a tributary of the Thames, and was for many years an important fishing port.  Three trenches were excavated within the proposed development area. The trenches revealed activity dating back to the Medieval period, likely associated with occupation along the northern part of North Street. In Trench 1 the remains of wall foundation cut F1032 is indicative of probably 19th Century activity. Foundation cut F1032 cut an earlier feature; undated pit/ditch F1043. Linear features F1005 and F1006 contained no dating evidence but were cut through a possible former occupation layer of later Medieval date (L1009). In Trench 2 no evidence of the modern cellar re-using earlier foundations was identified. In Trench 3 a large negative feature containing later 16th/17th Century pottery may have represented a boundary ditch or, more likely, a large pit. Two further undated irregular features, and a third containing sparse pottery sherds of Medieval date, were also recorded in Trench 3.

All trenches except one revealed a similar intact soil profile with evidence of possible Early Bronze Age activity in the form of struck flint waste flakes and tools; no archaeological features were recorded. The finds possibly showed evidence for some spatial distribution but had been slightly disturbed, probably in the Post Medieval period, by plough action. Fragments of Roman ceramic building material were also recovered from the same levels as the struck flints.  The Post Medieval ploughing had produced a green grey agricultural soil containing disturbed flints, Post Medieval pottery and 19th/20th Century bottle glass. During the 20th Century the site had been re-graded with some terracing into the chalk bedrock to the south and levelling up with dumped material to the north.

This event relates to the building recording element, see ELO14804 for the watching brief record. This work involved related documentary research; and survey of the buildings, including a photographic survey, as part of the redevelopment at King's Cross Station. This work involved building upon an existing photographic survey of the Western Range and two phases of recording the building's fabric. Part of this range: Kings Cross station, is Grade I listed. The work was undertaken between 2008 and 2011.  King's Cross Station was built as the London terminus of the Great Northern Railway in 1852 to designs by Lewis Cubitt. At the time of its construction the principles behind the design and layout of large passenger terminals were yet to be fully established. Cubitt's designs provided the GNR with an efficient and simple layout to the station buildings and an uncomplicated yet striking public faÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ade, made all the more significant by its contrast to the palatial Gothic of St Pancras Station, which opened later in 1868. The Western Range building at King's Cross was the working heart of the station, housing the Booking Hall, waiting rooms and refreshment rooms for the public as well as board rooms, office rooms, strong rooms and the Parcel Office. The building also contained large storage facilities in the basement for food, beer and wine, whilst attic areas were utilised to house large water tanks for fresh water. The historic building recording included a watching brief on the redevelopment and refurbishment of the Western Range allowing hiden features to be recorded. The majority of the demolition occurred internally, with selected partition walls, floors and fireplaces being removed. The opening up and enabling works exposed much of the buildings fabric, structure and details which were examined and analysed as and when feasible. These elements were then interpreted and appropriately recorded, having regard to their historical and architectural significance.",A GIS polygon was drawn over the approximate extent of the site.

The trenches were then excavated by machine until archaeological horizons were reached and excavation then continued by hand.  The natural sands and gravels were consistent with Kempton Park Gravel formation and overlain by sub-soil horizons containing sherds of late-Roman pottery. These horizons were then overlain by further deposits of plough soil thought ot be of Medieval and early Post Medieval date.  Two 17th Century pits wre cut through the soils, one of which contained a large groups of ceramics deposited in the second half of the 17th Century. These features were ealed by made ground deposits associated with the redevelopment of the site in the 18th Century. Wall foundations and a late-18th Century cellar were uncovered.

An assessment of dendrochronological potential found that the timbers associated with the roof and floor were unsuitable for dendrochronological analysis as they contained less than 40 annual growth rings. Following this a programme of radiocarbon dating and wiggle matching was agreed.  Martin Bridge was commissioned to take core samples from a series of timber, primarily those associated with the primary construction. The details of 10 samples are provided in the report. Ulm05 is thought to have been reused as it has a redundant peg hole. Cores ulm07 and ulm10 were considered unsuitable for wiggle matching as they contained few annual growth rings. Three cores, ulm01, ulm03 and ulm04, were associated with the primary construction and were selected for sub-sampling for radiocarbon dating and subsequent wiggle-matching. A series of five individual annual growth rings were sub-sampled from each core. These 15 samples were analysed by Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit (OxA), Queens University Belfast 14CHRONO Centre (UBA), and the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC).  As a result of the analysis it was found that the extant range at 91 High Street is earlier than previously thought and dates to the 14th Century.

The scheme comprises the demolition of the late 1980s building on the site and the construction of a multistorey block containing flats, shops and a car showroom. A lower ground floor and a basement are proposed across the site footprint. The foundations would be piled. This desk-based study assesses the impact on buried heritage assets (archaeological remains). Although above ground heritage assets (historic structures) are not discussed in detail, they have been noted where they assist in the archaeological interpretation of the site. Buried heritage assets that may be affected by the proposals comprise: A moderate potential for buried footings of late 17th Century and later buildings, of low significance. These might include houses and 19th Century warehouses. A low to moderate potential for Roman remains associated with a Roman road which is thought to have followed the line of The Highway. This might include evidence of agriculture or quarrying, of low significance, roadside ditches or roadside settlement or burials, of medium or high significance. A low to moderate potential for evidence of later Medieval settlement. There was a small roadside settlement at Wapping which may have extended into the site; such remains would be of medium significance. There may have been an earlier (Saxon) settlement here although no remains have been found in the vicinity.  A low to moderate potential for Prehistoric remains. The site straddles the gravel terrace edge and the Thames floodplain. Evidence of exploitation of the former marshland and activity on the drier gravel would potentially be of high significance.  A moderate potential for palaeoenvironmental remains with the potential to contribute to understanding of past environments, of low to medium significance. Such remains would be within any floodplain alluvium and peat deposits. The construction of the ground floor of the existing building involved terracing the existing natural slope in order to create a level surface. This is likely to have completely removed any archaeological remains from the northern part of the site (the upper part of the slope), whilst remains in the south (the lower part of the slope, where the site overlies alluvium), are likely to survive intact, buried and preserved beneath the redeposited material. The foundations of the current building will have removed any remains locally. Given the nature of past disturbance and the current building, impacts on any archaeological remains are likely to be limited to the southern part of the site. The proposed demolition, including breaking out of the existing foundation/floor slab, would potentially truncate or remove entirely any archaeological remains directly beneath the slab. Archaeological remains would be entirely removed within the footprint of the proposed basement to a level of -0.1m OD. Any archaeological remains within the footprint of each pile would be entirely removed; the severity of impact would depend on the pile size and density, which is not currently known. It is recommended that any preliminary geotechnical investigation is archaeologically monitored to confirm the level of natural deposits along with the presence and depth of any archaeological remains across the site. Based on the results, further work may be required prior to development, for example archaeological evaluation trenches or pits, in order to clarify the nature, date and significance of remains within the areas affected. The results would allow an appropriate mitigation strategy to be drawn up for the preservation by record of any significant archaeological assets. This might comprise targeted archaeological excavation in advance of construction, and/or a watching brief during ground works for remains of lesser significance. Alternatively, the preliminary investigations may indicate that no further work is necessary. Any archaeological work would need to be undertaken in accordance with an approved Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) and could be carried out under the terms of a standard archaeological planning condition set out with the granting of planning consent.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Using information gained from the augerhole exercise, deposit modelling at Ten Broadway illustrates the location of the site on the floodplain and channel of the northern branch of the river Tyburn. Analysis of the sediment retrieved from auger holes demonstrates that a freshwater river flowed across or near the site, depositing sandy sediment probably during the close of the last glacial stage to the early Holocene (the last 10 000 years). This was the early Tyburn River. The river dried up before peat deposits infilled the channel. Wetland developed as river levels across the south east of England rose in response to Holocene sea level rise.

The Roman road from London to Silchester lies directly to the north of the site (modern Brentford High Street) and therefore it is possible there will be remains of associated settlement and activity. In the Anglo-Saxon and Medieval periods the site lay immediately south of a linear settlement developing along the High Street so there may be evidence of agricultural and backlands activity dating to these periods.

In one trench against the northern side of the ice well, the external wall was exposed to a depth of c 7m from the apex of the roof and recorded by standing building survey. Further to this, the internal backfill of a subterranean passage, leading off from the ice well, was emptied along with a portion of the backfill within the ice well itself, affording further standing building recording to take place. A second trench overlying the western portion of the ice well uncovered an arched wall surmounting the roof of the ice house well. This wall was constructed at right angles to a north-south length exposed in 2015 which was of an identical construction. While both walls appear to be contemporary with the ice well, it is not clear whether their purpose was for purely structural reasons related to the subterranean ice well, or whether they formed the base for an above ground structure. A third trench to the south east of the ice well was beyond the limit of the structure itself and exposed only natural clay and brickearth deposits, overlain by Post Medieval soil horizons. An archaeological watching brief was carried out in three phases by Museum of London Archaeology at 16-26 Park Crescent West and 77-81 Portland Place, to record basement vaults. The first phase of fieldwork was in October 2015 when two basement vaults were recorded, prior to the demolition of the buildings of Park Crescent West. The second visit was made in August 2016 and a further two vaults were recorded after the demolition of the buildings. A final visit was made in December 2016 to record two more vaults. In addition the excavation of a services trench was monitored in the vicinity of the Ice House (recorded separately by Museum of London Archaeology during a watching brief between 5th and 25th August 2015). The six basement vaults and the front wall of the basement area were recorded and found to be constructed of identical materials (hand-made brick and sandy lime mortar), though the structures of the vaults and the front wall were not bonded together and in general the construction was of a very poor quality. The vaults were subsequently back-filled with concrete foam. During the monitoring of the service trench adjacent to the Ice House, a section of brick wall was recorded with an arched, bonded with a sandy lime mortar, built contemporaneously with the ice house well. The required service ducts could be passed through the arch, so after recording, the wall was protected with geotextile and the trench backfilled with gravel to help support the arch. The Ice House was recorded separately, though under the same site code and a separate report will be produced in due course.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The evaluation involved a two stage approach with five evaluation trenches to investigate the upper levels of archaeological remains and four geo-archaeological auger holes to investigate and sample the deeper, natural deposits.  The trenches measured 2m by 2m and the augerholes o.2m by 0.2m in diameter. Trenches were excavated by contractors using a mechanical excavator equipped with a smooth-bladed grading/ditching bucket under Museum of London Archaeology supervision. Trenches were then cleaned by Museum of London Archaeology staff. The auger holes were excavated by Museum of London Archaeology geo-archaeologists using a Cobra TT power auger. The sediments were logged and subsampled on site. They were drilled to the surface of the Pleistocene sand and gravel deposits in order to recover a complete sequence of Holocene floodplain deposits.   The augerholes revealed moderately deep sequences (to around 4.5m depth) of alluvial deposits, interspersed with peats. The alluvial deposits underlaid 1.5m of made gorund. Augerholes 2, 3 and 4 reaches the underlying river sands and gravles but augerhole 1 was refused at approximately 1m below ground level due to an obstruction in the made ground. The augerholes reveal that there were relatively high banks of underlying sand and gravel deposits dipping gently to the south from a maximum of -1.32mOD in AH2 to -1.96m OD in AH4. This is thought to represent a high area of sand and gravel at the edges of an ancient Pleistocene channel.  The earliest deposit in Trench 1 was a dark grey soft alluvium at 0.89m OD. The trench was sealed with modern brick rubble backfill laid at 3.10m OD, interpreted as modern demolition backfill.  The earliest feature in Trench 2 comprised a cobbled stone surface sealing the trench which was exposed at 2.62m OD. Numerous modern services were located below this level which caused the termination of the trench at 1.68-1.89m OD. The earliest deposit in Trench 3 comprised of a medium grey firm silty clay [119], interpreted as alluvium, exposed at 1.04m OD. Sealing the alluvium, a soft dark grey-brown silty clay [102] was laid at 1.78m OD, interpreted as a Post Medieval alluvium. This strata contained pottery ranging from 1630 to 1700 and comprised London red ware from the border of Surrey/Hampshire. This strate was sealed by a Post Medieval make up layer at 2.02m OD. A layer of modern rubble demolition backfill covered the layers and was laid at a level of 2.90m OD.  The earliest deposit in Trench 4 was a soft dark grey-brown silty clay [105] sealing the entire trench. This was interpreted as a Post Medieval alluvium, laid at 1.8m OD. This layer contained 19th Century whiteware pottery from the Surrey/Hampshire border. A layer of modern rubble demolition backfill covered [105] and was laid at a level of 2.8m OD.  The earliest deposit in Trench 5 was a medium grey-brown firm silty clay [118], interpreted as an alluvium and laid at 0.73m OD. A dark brown-grey soft silty clay layer [116] was laid at 1.1.4m OD, sealing [118]. This was interpreted as Post Medieval alluvium and contained one piece of pantile/roofing tile from the 18th or 19th Century. A hard medium brown consolidation layer [115] sealed [116] and was laid at 1.43m OD. A dumped deposit [114] was laid at 1.59m OD which comprised a compacted dark red-brown silty clay layer. This was interpreted a Post Medieval make-up deposit. Numerous 19th Century brick walls running north-south and east-west across the trench was laid at 2.37m OD. These walls were interpreted as remnants of wall foundations from the terraced buildings previously occupying the eastern part of the site. Sealing the brick walls a modern make-up layer was laid at 2.7m OD. The augerholes indicate that the site is located on the edge of an ancient Pleistocene channel, which ran to the south of the site. The c.-2m OD levels of the sand and gravels located across the site meant that they probably remained relatively high and dry until the Neolithic. The site was flooded from the Late Mesolithic as the Thames floodplain became unstable. This continued into the historic period but the rise in water levels experienced a distinct hiatus in the later Prehistoric (Neolithic and Bronze Age) and again in the Roman period. This reultued in widespread peat developing. The whole site was inundated under increasingly saline tidal muds from the later Prehistoric/early historic periods. The rises in river level abated in the Post Medieval period allowing the land to stabilise and soils to develop.  There is low potential for survival of earlier ground surfaces across the area but there is at least moderate potential for survival of horizontally truncated layers and/or brick structures across the site (found in three out of five trenches).  There is potential for Post Medieval alluvium to survive throughout the site, which has extended down to a maximum depth of 0.43 OD.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

This monitored the excavation of a small trench in preparation for the installation of a new boiler.  The trench measured 3.1m in length with a maximum width of 1m and depth of 0.25m. The watching brief provided the opportunity to record a small section of masonry beneath the threshold through to Turret GF249. This may pre-date Cardinal Wolsey's building phase.

Report summerising the work carried out in February to March 2014 and also undertaken in August to October 2015 inorder to prevent further erosion to the foreshore to help shore up the river wall adjectent to the Tower of London. The river wall adjacent to the Tower of London forms part of London's tidal flood defences and is an integral part of the World Heritage Site and Scheduled Monument. In the past ten years, the foreshore level at the east end next to Tower Bridge has dropped by as much as 2.2m from a foreshore level recorded in 1924, exposing the weakly bound foundation material and as a result the wall was at imminent risk of collapse. Existing archaeological features were recorded by Museum Of London Archaeology and protected with sand bags. Construction of emergency works started in February 2014 and finished in March 2014. Although the emergency works proved to be a functional solution, they were not considered to be in keeping with the historic setting of the Scheduled Monument or the World Heritage Site. A permanent solution was developed, which retained the Kyowa units and consisted of raising the foreshore back up to historic levels with coarse graded crushed Kentish Ragstone rock, capable of resisting scouring forces, and a finer rock dressing on top. The raised foreshore levels were retained behind a timber capped sheet pile retaining wall Scour protection riverward of the campshed wall was achieved by relocating some Kyowa units. The objectives were to improve the stability of the river wall and the integrity of the flood defence, as well as restore a natural appearance to the foreshore. The permanent works were constructed between August and October 2015.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The windmill is Grade II* listed (List Entry Number 1079878), owned by the London Borough of Havering and is managed on their behalf by a registered charity; the Friends of Upminster Windmill. The windmill was built in 1803 and was used for corn milling until its closure in 1934. The site housed 16 buildings associated with the industry. Following its closure, the site was left to decay and become derelict. Despite the demolition of the surrounding building, the mill structure itself was made safe in the 1960s. Over the following years repairs were undertaken to allow for the opening of the mill to the general public.   The programme of archaeological works comprised a community archaeology historic building survey with onsite excavation and recording training programmes. The excavated remains comprise three distinct buildings: the Meal-House, the Steam Mill and a Pig sty. The Meal House is the earliest 19th -Century building, followed by the Steam Mill, with a courtyard wall, and then finally the Pig Sty, which was constructed in the 20th Century.

On the other side of Spinney Drive is a large double ditched enclosure and a large Neolithic cursus was located at Heathrow Airport (to the west of the site). Previous excavations and research has suggested that there was extensive Prehistoric occupation in the surrounding landscape.  The Roman Road from Silcheter through Staines to London lies to the south of the site.  The topsoil and later made ground deposits were removed by machine to the underlying gravel in spits of no more than 5-10cm. Removal continued until the first archaeological significant layer [004] and the natural sands and gravels were reached. The surface was cleaned by hand.  It was not possible to excavate the easternmost part of the trench down to gravel so the effective excavated area measured 4m x 2 1/2 m.  The topsoil covered the whole trench to a depth of between 25cm to 30cm. A large linear feature [007], aligned south, south-west to north, north-east, cut across the south-eat corner of the excavation. This was interpreted as a modern sewer trench as its alignment was between a manhole cover to the NE of the excavation and another manhole cover in the road.  A layer of brick earth [002] covered the whole trench to a depth of between 20cm to 25cm. The only find was a Medieval rim sherd from the upper part of the deposit.  A narrow gully 50cm wide aligned just S of W to just N of E was cut into the gravel [005] (west: 18.988m OD to east: 19.005m OD). It appeared that the upper part had been truncated. The gully was excavated to the west and found to widen out to 60cm and the sides were slightly steeper and the porfile 'U' shaped. The fill contained two small fragments of burnt flint.  A cicular feature was found in the northern section. This was only 2cm deep in the centre and there were no finds.  In summary: it appears there was no Prehistoric occupation in the immediate area of the site.",

The two new boreholes alongside two boreholes from 65 Southwark Street, five from Surrey House and 13 BGS borehols from around the area of the site were used to create a deposit model.  The description and deposit model have shown that 61 Southwark Street lies on the southern margin of the Bankside Channel where the Gravel surface is recorded at -0.35m OD in the north-western area of the site rising to 0.9m OD in the southeast. BH1 has a sequence of Holocene sedimentation over the Shepperton Gravel which follows: lower, sandy Alluvium, Peat and clayey Upper Alluvium which is overlain by Made Ground.

One trench was excavated (Trench 2), which was located outside the footprint of the existing and backfilled basement of the demolished property at 325 Borough High Street. Trench 2 measured 3.8m NW-SE by 4.40m NE-SW. The trench was excavated by a mechanical excavator until the archaeological horizon was reached.  Mostly untruncated natural was observed in the NE half of Trench 2 at 1.98m OD and at 1.59m OD in the SW half (where it was horizontally impacted by a late Post Medieval cellar. The truncation meant that only a small area of archaeological sequence remained intact in Trench 2.  A series of post holes in a N-S orientation characterise the earliest Roman occupation of the site; these are possibly a fence line which pre-dated the construction of the Roman road. Following this phase were a series of intercutting and amorphous features contianing a small quantity of Roman pottery. It has been interpreted that these reflect quarrying of sand and gravel in association with the construction of roads.  Lienar intercutting ditch cuts characterise the early Post Medieval activity. This is thought to represent the cut and re-cut of a property boundary/division.  During the 18th Century a cobbled surface was constructed, sealing the aforementioned ditches. This is interpreted as a yard, which may date to the late 17th Century (a yard is shown on the Morgan map of AD 1682). In the second half of the 19th Century the yard went out of use and a series of consolidation deposits were dumped on top. In the late 19th Century, these deposits were truncated when a cellar was inserted in the SW half of the excavation.

Natural gravelly clays (Taplow Gravel Formation) were recorded between 21.17m and 21.30m aod. This was overlain by a probable buried topsoil deposit containing a 17th or 18th Century clay tobacco pipe. In trench 2 the buried topsoil sealed an east to west aligned linear cut feature. This contained Post Medieval brick fragments and is thought to follow the property alignment, which was established by at least 1819.

The evaluation comprised two evaluation trenches in the north-west and east of the basement and one trial pit.  Natural gravels were recorded at comparable levels (-0.44m OD) in both of the trenches. The natural gravels were overlain by alluvial horizons and brickearth to an upmost elevation of -0.10m OD. Residual Prehistoric activity was found within the alluvial deposits. Burnt flint and struck flint were recovered from an uppermost elevation of 0.60m OD. The Prehistoric activity was exclusively located along the western side of the site, suggesting the Channel lay to the east. This will have truncated earlier deposits and features.  Two phases of Roman activity were encountered along the western side of the site, corresponding with known areas of high ground. The earlier phase dated from the late 2nd Century AD and comprised episodes of water management of the defining of property boundaries. These features were abandoned, which was followed by a later third Century phase of refuse disposal or levelling.  Four phases of Medieval activity were identified, dating from the late 11th Century. This evidence illustrates the reoccupation of the area.  In the early Post Medieval period it appears the site was located to the rear of properties due to the presence of a well and dumped debris. By the later Post Medieval period construction had occurred on the site. Masonry walls were observed dating to between 1800 and 1900. These were presumably demolished following World War II bombing.  The differences in the archaeology between the east and west of the site suggests that there was a boundary between, likely a wet channel was to the east and dry land to the west.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The excavation was commissioned by Living Architects on behalf of the Diocese of Brentwood and was undertaken in compliance with a planning condition attached to planning permission for the construction of a new four classroom unit (London Borough of Barking  and  Dagenham Planning Ref. 11/01014/FUL).      The site had a high potential for archaeological remains, in particular for the Anglo-Saxon, Medieval and Post Medieval archaeology.  Such remains may relate to Barking Abbey, as well as the Medieval and later development of the town.  The evaluation did not reveal Anglo-Saxon or Early Medieval remains, and the Medieval and Post Medieval remains are likely associated with 'backyard' activity.  The aims of the excavation were to preserve by record the archaeological evidence contained within the site prior to ground disturbance associated with the development.     Like the evaluation the excavation revealed Medieval (11th-13th Century), Post Medieval (late 16th - 18th Century) and modern features.

The Bull Alley is located to the north of the suspected line of the Roman Road 'popularly refered to as Watling Street' which runs through Welling. The report concluded that the archaeological evidence across the eastern side of Welling clearly demonstrated that during the Roman period there was some form of isolated farm or small settlement activity across the area. This appeared to have been laid out alongside the Roman Road. Associated with the settlement activities were a number of cremation burials, probably positioned along the edge of the settlement.  From the historical and cartographic evidence across the Welling area, it appears that up until the maps of c.1769 and 1778, the Bull Alley site may have been within the confines of an Early Medieval village at Welling, which was surrounded by open field systems, heath-land and woodland. By later OS maps, Welling and Bexleyheath had started to develop out to the east and west along the line of the Old Roman Road. Once this was established, the villlage spread out to the north and south beyond the line of the road.  Further archaeological investigation was recommended as taking the form of a watching brief during groundworks.","A GIS polygon was created over the estimated area of the site. No grid references were supplied within the original report, therefore the site was found using mapping software, and a polygon was created based upon the limited description provided in the literature of the report.

The only element of historic interest on the ground floor was deemed to be the retained piece of original shopfront, which fronts onto Bainbridge Street. Internally, the shop has been refitted many times and the plan form is therefore of no historic interest. An original secondary staircase is, however, still present.  The application site is a landmark building, which contributes to the significance of the Conservation Area due to its location, scale and architectural detailing. However, it was concluded that the modern shopfronts do not contribute to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and are at odds with the detailing of the upper floors.

The evaluation comprised 2 large stepped trenches which covered a combined area of 375m squared at surface level. The trench in the southwest corner of the site (Trench 1) revealed a substantial building complex dating from the 17th and 18th Centuries. It is thought these buildings were demolished prior to the construction of the railway viaduct which runs to the south of the site. Below these buildings were alluvial deposits were probably deposited in the Medieval period. This alluvium was on top of an embankment, the base of which consisted of late Roman deposits. This river defence was probably constructed or maintained during the Early Medieval or Medieval periods. Evidence of Roman occupation was evident below the embankment.  The second trench (Trench 4) revealed the eastern part of the site had been open ground during the 17th and 18th Centuries. As in the first trench, Medieval alluvium was present beneath this layer but no embankment was recorded. Earlier rivering and man-made deposits sealed a 4th Century Roman ditch. This had been excavated through earlier Roman deposists, including building debris.  A watching brief was also conducted during the removal of a basement and associated wall foundations in the northwest corner of the site. This revealed a substantial timber structure which is thought to date to the Roman period.  Auger holes were also located between the two evaluation trenches and used for a geoarchaeological survey. The geoarchaeological survey was carried out in Trench 1 on the 25/10/2013. This revealed a fluvial system represented by a series of light olive brown alluvial silty clay deposits with darker grey silt bands and laminae. Each band represents a different deposition phase. In the eastern section this sequence of deposition has been disturbed by a construction cut for a Post Medieval wall. There was an attempt to manage the fluvial system with a manmade bank, the management of which has a clear number of phases as the bank failed and was rebuilt.",A GIS polygoon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The 1871 OS map shows extensive urbanisation around the site. There is a terrace of three houses at the southern end of the site and several other buildings, likely associated with the railway development. The site was further developed in the 1896 OS map. An aerial image from 1945 illustrates the dense semi-industrial urbanisation of the study site.

The saltmarsh was reclaimed by Barking Abbey in stages during the Medieval period. The reclaimed marshes had a pattern of field ditches which are thought to have remained consistent from c.1799 to c.1950.   It is thought that deep alluvial deposits seal Neolithic and Bronze Age peat deposits, estimated at being 2.5m thick. Timber trackways dating to the Neolithic and Bronze Age have survived in similar deposits.

Two trenches were excavated by machine. Trench 1 (TR1) was located at the northern end of the site and orientated on a northeast to southwest axis. The trench had a 2m x 6m exposure on the surface of the mixed gravel geology of the trench at 0.52m OD. A slot was excavated by machine toa depth of 0.06m OD at the southern end of the trench to corroborate the natural geology.  Trench 2 (TR2) was located at the west of the site and orientated on a northeast to southwest axis. It had a 2m x 6m exposure on the surface of the mixed gravel and clay geology of the trench at 0.50mOD. A slot was excavated to a depth of -0.15m OD at the eastern end of the trench to corroborate the natural geology. The eastern end of the trench had a deep alluvial clay, devoid of archaeological material.  In trench 1 the earliest deposit was a layer of stiff medium greyish borwn silty clay at 0.71m - 0.21m OD on top of a natural sandy gravel. This was devoid of finds. The layer was sealed by a stiff greenish black silty clay at 0.97m - 0.71m OD, which contained fragments of animal bone, shell and CBM fragments. It also had flecks of charcoal and chalk or mortar. This contents of this deposit were similar to those in the deposit above, which also contained a sherd of white and blue painted pottery. Wall 105 was constructed of shallow frogged red and yellow bricks. Wall 106 was constructed of the same material. It is thought they date to early to mid 19th Century.  In trench 2 the earliest deposit consisted of a yellow silty clay deposit, which was predominant on the western half of the trench base and visible in the south facing section. This was interpreted as natural and was located at 0.50m OD. This was sealed by a layer of dark brown clay which was cut by a linear ditch, filled with a homogenous dark blueish grey sity clay deposit.

During that period sequences of clay and timber buildings were constructed on either side of a north-south road. This was one of two Roman roads that are known to have crossed the Paternoster Square area at right angles to the major east-west road on the line of modern Newgate Street. The road had a long period of use and was resurfaced on several occasions. Some of the flanking buildings were burnt, and it is possible that they were destroyed during the Hadrianic fire in c. AD 120. Pits, quarries and wells indicate the locations of open areas adjacent to the buildings.There is less evidence for later Roman occupation of the site due to subsequent truncation. At least one 3rd Century building was constructed to the west of the road, on top of earlier buildings. It was of relatively high status, with tessellated floors and (probably) masonry walls. In the 4th Century AD, five human inhumations were buried in graves dug into the surface of the Roman road, indicating that by then part of the road at least had gone out of use.The evidence for Medieval activity on the site consists of some truncated pits, part of the east-west chalk foundation (of uncertain date) and a lead water pipe that is interpreted as part of the Great Conduit system that provided London's first public water supply from the 13th to the 17th Century.",

The evaluation comprised the excavation of two trenches at the eastern (trench 1) and western (trench 2) ends of the site. Trench 1 measured 20m by 6m and was located to pick up features associated with Roman Roads. Trench 2 measured 35m by 6m and was located to pick up Watling Street and any associated activity, as well as the River Peck. Both trenches were opened by a mechanical excavator and the overburden was removed.  In Trench 1 the natural alluvial sands were recorded at an upper limit of +0.87m OD. There was a possible palaeochannel containing a fine gravel and silt within these sands. This was overlain by orange sands and clays, with an upper limit of +0.95m OD. Alluvial clays were recorded above this at an upper limit of +2.40m OD. In the upper horizon of the clats claypipe and Post Medieval pottery were found. Four 19th Century bricklined pits were recored truncating the alluvial clays and sands to a maximum depth of +0.64m OD. In Trench 2 the  natural alluvial sands were recorded at an upper limit of +0.66m OD.  This was overlain by a possible Prehistoric horizon, with an upper limit of +1.03m OD. Alluvial clays were recorded above this at an upper limit of +1.97m OD. These were heavily truncated by modern overburden and rubbish pits. Two 19th Century bricklined pits were recorded truncating the alluvial clays and sands to a depth of +0.80m OD. The alluvial clays and sands are likely related to the floodplain of the near-by River Peck or another ancient river. The alluvial deposits also suggest that the ground surface during the Roman and Prehistoric periods was low lying and there unsuitable for the building of Roman Roads. Their alignment may have veered on to higher ground to the north east side of the Old Kent Road.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Three test pits and one borehole were monitored.  Test Pit 1 measured 2m by 0.5m and the earliest deposit was a firm, blue clay of alluvial origin. This was observed at 31.35m AOD. This was overlain by an undistubed white, sandy gravel deposit thought to be river terrace gravels (2.70m thick). Overlying this was a sandy gravel soil horizon, measuring 0.35m thick. This may have been a dark grey colour due to petrochemical contamination. This was sealed by a dark, organic sandy silt peat deposit. Above this was a made ground deposit. Two pieces of worked flint were recovered from this context.  Test Pit 2 measured 2m by 0.5m and as with Test Pit 1 had a sequence of alluvial clay and then river terrace gravels. This was then overlain by a horizon of possible peaty material, which was in turn sealed by a sequence of made ground deposits. The oldest of these deposits consisted of redeposited yellow Terrace Gravels contianing fragments of CBM. The sequence was sealed by topsoil.  Test Pit 3 also measured 2m by 0.5m and had a sequence of alluvial clay followed by undisturbed yellow, sandy River Terrace Gravels. Above this was a sandy gravel soil horizon followed by a dark brown, organic, sandy silt, peat deposit. This was overlain by a made ground deposit which was sealed by a topsoil.  Borehole BH 102 measured 0.40m in diameter. The lowest deposit recorded was a firm mid grey alluvial clay which contained frequent mollusc shells. This was sealed by a very darkgreyish black peat which had frequent organic inclusions. This peat deposit is thought to only be in the south of the site and is of Palaeolithic date. The peat was overlain by hard orange Wandle terrace gravels, which were sealed by a mottled orangey brown silty gravel made ground and topsoil.  The Palaeolithic peat horizon is the only significant deposit recorded. The only finds recovered are from the made ground deposits and as such are unlikely to be in situ. The sequence of deposits suggests modern truncation has been limited so the potential for any archaeology to survive is high.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

As the site is within the floodplain for the River Thames it was suggested that any alluvium on the site is likely to have a high potential for palaeoenvironmental remains. It is also suggested that there is potential for evidence of the exploitation of the wetland area. The higher parts of the floodplain may have been settled in the early Prehistoric period while the lower parts of the floodplain may have been exploited for various resources. Evidence of this may be within the waterlogged alluvial deposits and would be medium or high heritage significance.

The site was found to be located close to the scheduled monument of Howbury moated site, adjacent to the Grade II listed Howbury Barn with locally listed cottages located to the south of the barn. The site is also close to the Oak Road Conservation Area, within the Howbury Moated Manor APA and adjacent to the Crayford Marshes and River Darent APA and Howbury Grange APA.  Historically the site was part of an open marshland and later agricultural landscape around the moated site.  It was concluded that the site may contain significant buried archaeology. The site has potential to contain Prehistoric archaeological remains and geo-archaeological evidence for past environments. Ordnance Survey maps of 1897 and 1933 show a tumulus or barrow marked in the eastern part of the application site. The 1933 map also shows a sharp slope around the western and central parts of the site; this may have been caused by the ground levelling to create the sports ground and pavillion on the western boundary.  The site contributes to the historic value of the designated heritage assets. It also contributes to the aesthetic value of the Grade II listed barn. Construction of housing on parts of the site will harm the significance of the listed barn and scheduled monument as it will change the current open setting of the assets.",

The site is situated within an area of former marsh, known from previous investigations to contain deposits of peat and alluvium. Deposit modelling of Site Investigation (SI) data during an initial geoarchaeological desk-based assessment (namely geotechnical window sampling and test pit log data, supplemented by British Geological Survey logs and previous local archaeological studies) showed that thick peat deposits lay beneath the site, often at some depth. These peats overlay alluvial clays and the underlying geology, indicating that the peat deposits were in places interleaved with estuarine silts and clays - reflecting fluctuations in relative sea level - before being inundated and sealed by thicker estuarine deposits.  Guided by the results of the geoarchaeological desk based assessment, six boreholes were drilled to a depth of 8m to retrieve continuous samples of sediment through the underlying estuarine alluvial sequence.    The samples recovered represented a fairly uniform Pleistocene gravel surface ranging in height from -6.2m OD in the north to -7.5m OD in the south. This gravel surface was in turn overlain by up to 7.5min thickness of alluvial silts, clays and peat which in turn was overlain by the modern topsoil.  No archaeological remains or artefacts were recovered from the core samples, but the sequences have good potential to inform our knowledge of the landscape and vegetation history in prehistory, thus providing a palaeoenvironmental context for known and yet to be discovered archaeology in the local area. A programme of further work has been recommended, in the form of palaeoenvironmental assessment supported by radiocarbon dating.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate area of the whole site which contained several separate test-pit and bore-hole areas.

Each trench measured 30m x 2m. The trenches were mechanically excavated to the first archaeological horizon or the surface of the underlying gravel. Once archaeological horizons were encountered, hand excavation took over. In trenches outside the footprints of new structures the excavation of the trenches was limited to 2m, which was the maximum depth of the drainage attenuation installations.  Trenches 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18, and 19 were devoid of archaeology and consisted of modern concrete and made ground truncating the alluvial clay and/or gravel. Trench 7 was not excavated.  A linear ditch was found in trench 8 cut into the clay alluvial deposits. This was aligned approximately N-S and had a shallow U-shaped profile. This may be one of the linear boundaries depicted on historical maps from the 19th Century.  Within trench 10 several archaeological features cut the surface of a firm orange, brown sandy clay silt. The features comprised a linear ditch, two pits and two post-holes. The ditch ran N-S and had a V-shaped profile. Four pottery sherds dating to the middle-late Bronze Age were recovered from the middle and upper fills of the ditch. Pit 1012 contained a piece of middle Bronze Age pottery, fragments of tooth enamel (probably from cattle) and charcoal, burnt flint and fired clay. Pit 1006 contained worked and burnt flint, fired clay and pottery. A total of 155 sherds of pottery were recovered, forming 40% of a single middle Bronze Age thick-walled jar with a fingernail-impressed cordon on the vessel wall. There were also significant quantities of charred materials. The postholes contained burnt flint and sherds of middle Bronze Age pottery, probably from Globular Urns. Charred cereal grains were recovered from posthole 1015.  A posthole was recorded in trench 11.  Trench 15 contained a ditch with a sharp V-shaped base. It was in-filled with silting fills. This ditch continued into trench 16. In trench 16, middle Bronze Age pottery sherds were recovered along with single cattle molars. A small number of worked flint and burnt flint fragments were also recovered.   The quantity and character of the finds assemblages suggest the features may represent a significant later Prehistoric occupation site.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The work involved the recording of the crypt structure, archaeological watching briefs during the excavation of four areas within the churchyard, and recording of funerary architecture. The principal work was the recording of the 781 coffins located in the seven vaults leading off the central chamber of the crypt, prior to their being removed for reburial elsewhere. All were triple coffins, mainly comprising an upholstered wooden case, a lead shell and an inner wooden coffin. Where coffins had already been perforated due to collapse, oxidisation or vandalism, and the decency of the occupant had already been compromised, the human remains were analysed on site by osteoarchaeologists. Coffins which remained largely intact were not opened. Analysis was carried out on the bones, with the level dependant on the ability to identify the individual.

The area around Trench 4 was stripped to the top of natural deposits or the top of the first archaeological horizon and investigated by full, open-area excavation. The excavation measured 32m (east to west) x 10m (north to south).  The natural geology comprised sands and gravels of the Pleistocene Kempton Park Gravel Formation and was observed at  3.62m OD to 3.98m OD. The gravel was truncated by a natural feature in the eastern half of the excavation area. The feature was irregular in plan with  steeply sloping, irregular sides and a concave base; it was interpreted to be a tree throw.  Residual Roman material was recovered during the excavation however the earliest occupation is likely to have been within the Medieval period. Two postholes, located towards the south-east corner of the excavation area may have been associated with a late Medieval or possibly early Post Medieval timber structure that extended beyond the eastern and southern boundaries of the site.

A site strip to a depth of between 450-750mm below ground level and the excavation of drainage runs was monitored.  The earliest deposit recorded was a layer of natural gravelly sands. The level of 11.83m OD is a truncated horizon.  Above the natural was a corner of a brick wall.  The brick fabric type, mortar type and stonework elements provided a date range for this wall of 1480-1700. This is thought to relate to the southeast corner of the Tanhouse; a tannery converted into a dwelling in the late 15th Century.  Recorded directly to the east of the Tanhouse was an unusual rectangular brick structure. This was constructed directly against the Tudor wall and therefore has a direct association with Tanhouse. It is thought this is a soakaway or water holding tank. The brick fabrics and mortar of this structure and associated downpipes suggests an 18th Century date. Alterations to this structure during the 19th Century, such as blocking the downpipe, are thought to coincide with the demolition of the Tanhouse during the early 19th Century prior to the construction of Sutton House.  Above the rectangular structure were a series of late 19th and 20th Century layers representing levelling and occupation predominantly associated with the Breaker's Yard.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The report was commissioned by Babtie, Brown & Root on behalf of the client, The Environment Agency. The proposed works entail the repair and refurbishment of the eastern wall of Queenhithe dock. There are two options (Option 3 and Option 3A) for undertaking these works which are considered in this document.  Archaeological deposits survive on the site behind (and potentially under) the wall below modem truncation levels, to a depth of several metres. Documentary evidence, and site investigation work indicate that deposits identified in a borehole to the east of the river wall and the dock are likely to lie within the Medieval dock. Indications from strati graphic and finds evidence are that this area was not infilled until the 17th Century at earliest. The degree of disturbance caused by services and earlier remedial and temporary works is known to be high but the extent is not fully established.  The principal impact of the proposed works depends on the option selected. Option 3 entails the excavation of a large quantity of material which may include archaeological strata to the rear of the wall, though these strata post-date the Medieval dock and associated structures. Option 3A is likely to be less destructive but may partially affect existing deposits, which would predate the establishment of the Medieval dock, at depth due to the method of piling through the river wall.","A GIS point was created using a central grid reference.

The first phase of the investigation (November 2016) comprised the excavation of a trench measuring c.8m by 24.5m by 4.2-4.5m in depth. The second phase of the investigation comprised the excavation of two areas from the basement slab level measuring 1.2m x 6m by 1.5m depth and 1.2m x 3m by 1.5m depth. Trenches were excavated by machine and monitored by a Museum of London Archaeology supervisor. In area 1 (the first phase) the earliest layers revealed were a firm greenish grey clay at 1.55-1.75m OD, which was overlain by a c.150mm thick layer of gravelly sand. The gravelly sand was sealed by a bioturbated silty clay (400-450mm thick), which contained frequent sheep/goat horn cores, occasional organic material and CBM flecks/fragments dating 1400-1800. This was overlain by a dark humic clay, containing pottery dating to 1550-1700.  The clay was truncated by a large c.1m deep pit, which had a fill containing pottery dating to 1760-1810 in addition to rubble, wood and waste metal, indicating a later date than the pottery. These features were sealed by a series of sandy and gravelly silt deposits (containing residual pottery dating 1580-1800) and the sequence was completed with a horizon of made ground containing 20th Century building material and rubbish.  The trenches excavated during the second phase of the evaluation revealed a natural sandy gravel at c.0.9-1m OD, which was overlain by a firm blue to greenish grey clay , which was truncated by modern construction activity at c. 1.3-1.4m OD.

The building is of national significance principally as one of the few remaining examples of Inigo Jones' architecture to still survive. Its status as the herald of a new style of classical architecture in the country is unchallenged. The only surviving whole building from the once magnificent royal palace of Whitehall, it is remarkable for its role as an architectural embodiment of the Stuart dynasty's ideas of kingship. Whilst the Jones' building fabric has been gradually eroded over the Centuries, his design has been preserved by a succession of prominent architects, whose work is also of great value in its own right. The paintings by Rubens, one of the most influential artists in the history of western art, are of immeasurable artistic and historical value and also embody the Stuart dynasty's sense of its own power and place in the world. As one of the largest and most accomplished works by the internationally acclaimed artist to still remain in the context for which they were designed, they are irreplaceable and extraordinary. As a nexus for the Stuart occupation of Whitehall Palace, the Banqueting House played a special role in the historical events of the nation, and these more intangible parts of its history lend added weight to the already great significance of the historic site.

The Site, formerly occupied by Pura Foods, is centred on Ordnance Survey NGR 539303 181181, and covers an area of approximately 4.7 ha (Figure 1). 1.1.2 The overall programme of work is required to meet a planning condition imposed by the Local Planning Authority relating to proposed redevelopment. The redevelopment comprises the construction of retail, commercial and residential units, including four tower blocks, in addition to a new bridge leading to Canning Town Station. 1.1.3 Earlier, the site had been occupied by the Thames Plate Glass Company, which operated during the middle of the 19th Century when glass manufacturing technology was highly sophisticated and the market for all types of glass was rapidly expanding. Most notably, there was a demand for ever larger areas of high quality plate glass, for which the company became a significant supplier. The redevelopment of the Leamouth North site provided the first opportunity to examine the material remains of a plate glass-works in Britain (and possibly the world) and, in particular, investigate the various technological and production processes involved. 1.1.4 Following consultation with David Divers (Archaeological Advisor to the London Borough of Tower Hamlets) it was recommended that a programme of archaeological investigations should be undertaken in parts of the Site where the desk-based assessment, in conjunction with cartographic evidence, had identified areas of potential archaeological significance surviving which related to the 19th Century Thames Plate Glass Company. To mitigate the impact of the construction scheme, 12 locations were designated for evaluation trenching, with five of these trenches subsequently expanded as part of the evaluation. One of these five areas was then further enlarged and investigated through detailed excavation. 1.1.5 It is the aim of this document to present the results of the archaeological excavations and associated programme of scientific investigation, and to assess their potential for further analysis and publication.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

A wide shallow ditch/depression was found in the southeastern corner of the trench and was undated. A posthole was found cutting the brickearth. The post hole was a light greyish brown silty brickearth and cannot be postively dated. It is thought to be Post Medieval.

Two site visits were made, alongside a walkover survey and desk-based study. The historic building assessment can be equated to a level 1-2 survey as defined by Historic England's 'Understanding Historic Buildings'.  The building is a grade II listed public house. At its core is a late 16th Century timber framed farmhouse. The building was mostly demolished in the very late 19th Century or early 20th Century and replaced by the current house (which is first seen on the 1913 OS map. This new footprint is largely unchanged until later additions appear by 1960, included extensions to the rear. The only surviving element of the earlier building is thought to be ceiling joists and a cross-beam in room 4, as one enters into the house. It is not known if these elements were left in situ and the new building built around them or if they were dismantled then reincorporated into the new fabric.  It was concluded that the proposed development will have little impact on the historic timbers and the special architectural and historic interest of the building (largely derived from the 16th Century ceiling joists) will not be harmed.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The evaluation included parametric sonar survey, a targeted walkover survey, hand augering, geoarchaeological and palaeoenvironmental assessment and the production of a foreshore deposit modenl.  The parametric sonar survey suggested that there is a significant depth of deposits on the foreshore overlying the London Clay. The targeted walkover survey successfully identified a variety of in situ timber structures on the foreshore of the site. Many of these were previously unknown. Structures recoreded include a well preserved barge bed with associated timber revetment, a possible timber jetty/slipway and at least one possible ship's timber was identified. Unstratified finds were also recovered. Most of the dateable finds were Post Medieval in date with the exception of three sherds of Romano-British pottery and single Prehistoric worked flint.  Hand augering was completed with limited success due to the sony active beach deposits.  The geoarchaeological deposit model predicts four landscape zones. Surface active beach deposits (LZ1) exist across the foreshore and are up to 0.7m thick. These overlie alluvium (LZ2), which is 0.8-1.7m thick, except in the southwest corner of the Site where river scour has removed alluvium.

The excavations comprised a large open area measuring approximately 410m squared. A second phase of the excavations were conducted between 16 June and 1 September 2000 at the eastern end of the Nag's Head Alley Workshop in an open area measuring approximately 197m squared.  During the exacation large, non structural linear features, e.g. channels, were sampled using regular spaced sondages along their length. In Nag's Head Yard, excavations were stopped at an agreed level to prevent the undermining of a contiguous piled wall. Three sondages were then excavated through the channel fills down to natural levels at c.0m OD. The excavations revealed a northeast-southwest aligned channel with a 1st Century timber revetment on the western edge. There were several timber structures within the channel, including possible jetties, a weir and a further revetment. The channel was backfilled in the early 2nd Century and the land reclaimed. Six clay and timber buildings of Hadrianic date were built over the backfilled channel. These fell into disuse in the late 2nd Century. An inhumation burial was cut into the demolition layer of one of the builings suggesting a hiatus in occupation.

It was concluded that the potential for Prehistoric archaeology is low, the potential for Roman archaeology is negligible, the potential for Early Medieval activity is negligible, the potential for Medieval activity is low and the potential for Post Medieval archaeology is considered high. On the Tithe map of 1801, the site is given over to pasture. By the OS Map of 1867 two buildings are located on the site. By 1894-96 these buildings are labelled as a Methodist chapel and Sunday school. Documentary sources suggest that the first buildings on the site were constructed in 1829 when a group of Wesleyans built a chapel for 110 worshipers on the eastern side of Lower Fore Street. This chapel was demolished and the foundation stone for a new 250 seat chapel laid in 1860. In 1864 Sunday School buildings were constructed behind the new chapel. In 1911 a new Central hall was opened south of the chapel and the chapel was demolished in 1929 and new Sunday School buildings erected.  It is these new Sunday School buildings which are proposed for demolition. The Central Hall was demolished in 1971.

Finds from the area surrounding the site indicate that the area was utilised during the early Prehistoric period but only on an ad hoc basis. However there is evidence for early Bronze Age to late Iron Age occupation in the area of the sewege works and the site may be within an area farmed by the people occupying this settlement, approximately 500m to the southwest. Similrarly the application site was probably farmed during the Roman period as part of the hinterland of the Roman Villa (a scheduled monument) located to the southwest. The site is thought to have been farmed throughout the Early Medieval, Medieval and Post Medieval periods. By 1940-41 the site had been subdivided into allotment gardens and by the early 1980s the current industrial estate (including the application site) had been developed.

It is suggested that the site has a low potential for Roman remains of moderate significance and high potential for 19th Century building remains of low significance in the central and eastern areas of the site. There is a low potential for archaeological remains of low significance for all other periods.  It is thought that the site was located within agricultural land in proximity of settlement until the 16th to 18th Centuries. On John Rocque's map of 1746 the site is occupied by low density buildings with yard and garden areas, and open fields to the south. By the 1874 Ordnance Survey map the site  is occupied by back to back terraced houses. The extreme north of the site is occupied by a building labelled 'The East London Theatre'. Consequently the site has a high potential for Post Medieval archaeology.  The basement levels of the 19th Century houses may have impacted archaeological deposits on the study site. The subsequent demolition of these properties will have further negatively impacted the archaeological remains.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The assessment site is situated immediately south of a railway line, and c. 240m west of Dagenham East station.  The assessment site lies to the north of Dagenham Village, which is recorded in a charter of 687 AD but is not mentioned in the Domesday Survey.  The village comprised houses lining the London to Tilbury Road at its junction with the road from Beacontree Heath to the north; its size and morphology changed little until the early 20th Century when the Becontree Housing Estate was built.    The assessment site lies on former agricultural land, known to have been meadow and pasture in the early 19th Century, and probably having had similar use before this time and up until the building of the railway line in 1885.  Field boundaries are known to have traversed the site.  A stream known as the Wantz Stream (and earlier as Wythenbrook and Wisdom Water) traversed the site, but was culverted at some time after 1962.    Being located on agricultural land outside of the Medieval and Post Medieval village, the potential for archaeology other than field boundary markers of these periods is low.

Cowie, L.Elvin and S.Padel conducted an archaeological watching brief of a trench excavated by contractors against the west side of the Abbey Barn. This was conducted rapidly by archaeologists who were working on a nearby archaeological training excavation. Firm brown silty clay survived to a maximum height of 4.68m OD and was excavated to a depth of 0.4m. This was interpreted as alluvium; other archaeological work suggests this palaeochannel was over 140m wide and had largely silted over by the Roman period.  The foundation of the west wall of the Abbey Barn was revealed: it was stepped and made of rough hewn stone, bonded with yellowish buff sandy mortar. The top lay c.0.9m below ground level (4.7m OD). The materials used in this foundation could indicate that the barn was built at the time of the abbey. A wall of soft orange-red brick bonded with buff sandy mortar extended up c.0.8m (12 courses) from the foundation to modern ground level. The bricks were mainly laid as headers. There were also strata of dump layers of sandy gravel and brick rubble, which were cut by an early 19th Century brick wall. This wall is thought to be a perimeter wall.  The discovery of an apparently very early element of the Abbey Barn is thought to be significant as the abbey as a whole is the only example of a Medieval Bridgettine house in the UK.",

Woodbridge House is within the Rockingham Conservation Area and comprises a U-Shaped unit of 20 almshouse units. The building is locally listed.  The almshouses were built in 1906 and designed to appear like 10 'houses' in a terrace but actually providing 20 apartments over two storeys. A shared garden was formed in the semi-open courtyard. The almshouses were designed by William Lionel Eves in a simplified Arts and Crafts vernacular. Each apartment opened into a small ground-floor lobby and then a bed-sitting room with a fireplace serving as a kitchen range. Six small two-storey closet wings serviced each room at the rear.  The almshouses were named Woodbridge House in 1962 in honour of the connection with the Woodbridge family, who owned a firm of solicitors in the High Street. Woodbridge House was refurbished in 1985 with the closet wings of the almshouses extended to contain a bathroom and fitted kitchen. In 1979 a building manager's house was added to the east end and an extension was built to the west end in 1986. Further extensions were built throughout the 1990s and early 2000s.  It was concluded that the loss of Woodbridge House would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Conservation Area as the public benefits of the proposed developments are significant: the continued provision of almshouses. Continued use is only possible through the redevelopment of the site. The loss of Woodbridge is deemed necessary as it is no longer fit for purpose",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

It is suggested that the site was within open fields or woodland during the Roman period. There is no evidence for Anglo-Saxon occupation in the vicinity of the site. During the Medieval period the site was set back from the main High Street of Hounslow and to the west of the Medieval roadside settlement. The site is thought to have been under cultivation or pasture during this period. It may also have been used for brickearth or gravel quarrying. In the 17th Century the site lay at the southern end of the 'Common' as indicated on Glover's map of 1635. The site remained undeveloped (apart from being occupied by an orchard in the mid 1800s) until large villa-style properties were constructed on the site in the late 19th Century. These buildings were demolished by the mid 1980s and the current structure constructed by 1987.  It is thought all archaeological deposits will have been removed from the eastern side of the site and the western side subject to the same truncation as on the Bath Road car park site. Archaeological potential is therefore restricted to the western half of the site and any deposits surviving here could be of medium significance but more likely of low-negligible significance.,A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The site accommodated a range of businesses including shoemakers, cheese makers, provisions dealers and confectioners. In 1937 the property operated as a stewed eel shop and was bought by the Kingdon family and run as an Eel Pie and Mash Shop from 1940. Analysis of the building suggests that the surivivng shop front and fixtures and fittings date to the 1930's when the shop was fitted out for the eel and pie shop. Surviving features unique to the industry include tiled and marbled surfaces, large and lowered shop front windows, decorative mirrors, ornamental tiles and chimney flue within the store and first floor rear store room.

Firstly, a watching brief was conducted on 40 geotechnical pits in August 2013. Test pits were generally 1m x 2m in plan and 3m deep. These were mainly to identify obstructions.  Secondly, in March to Arpil 2014 a targeted archaeological evaluation was undertaken. Seven evaluation trenches were excavated along a north-south line in the area thought to have the highest archaeological potential (not the east). The trenches were approx. 7m x 3m and reached a depth of 4m, excavated down to natural horizons. This revealed a series of Post Medieval walls, drains and brick lined pits. There was also evidence of the 19th Century redevelopment of the area and the damage the site suffered in World War II.  Finally, a 'strip, map and sample' excavation was conducted for the entire western portion of the site between November 2014 and March 2015. The area was split into two portions, the 'central and south' and 'north', as these areas required different methodologies.  When archaeological features and deposits during ground reduction by contractors, work was halted and the areas of interest were investigated, excavated and recorded. In the northern portion, machine excavation took place underneath a concrete slab.  Brick-lined pits wre deemed to be the main focus of the 'strip, map and sample'. Envrionmental bulk samples from the cess-pits and soak-aways were taken from a cleaned veritcal section. A large cut feature, which covered most of the weesternmost part of the excavation, was also fully recorded in plan and full-depth sections through the feature were cut every 10m. Envrionmental samples were taken of exposed fills.  The site produced evidence for two distinct periods of time: the Civil War and shortly after (mid 17th Century to early 18th Century) then a period of urban development from the 18th to 19th Century. It is thought that the large cut feature is related to Civil War defences. The urban ocucpation of the site in the second period left several brick-lined pits, the finds from which can shed light on social history and consumption.  The finds from this site are deemed to be of potentially regional significance.",

These excavations found that concrete settling tanks associated with a sewage works had destroyed all but the deepest deposits.  Gravels were noted at a maximum height of 2.83m OD. The brickearth cap was largely truncated by modern activity and where it existed was nomore than c.200mm thick.  A gully and ditch terminal at Pumping Station Rad [017,018] yielded worked flints and waste flakes attributable to the Neolithic to Bronze Age. 10 struct flints were recovered and had been knapped from local river gravel cobbles of variable size and quality. One flint ws a broken edge-damaged blade [017]. A piece of flint tempered material [001] is Prehistoric in date. Four pits/gullies lacked dateable finds but were similar in form to nearby dated features.  A pit of Roman date was discovered containing a quantity of roof tile, a scrap of lead waste and animal bone. Nine fragments of building material were recovered [003]: three brick, one 'imbrex' and five 'tegulae'. All of the tiles were very similar in fabric suggesting a shared origin. The tile fragments were large and unabraded, suggesting the structure they came from was located near by. These were tentatively dated to the 1st or early 2nd Century AD. 26 fragments (0.30 kg) of animal bone was recovered from the fill of the Roman pit [3]. Identification to species was not always possible due to considerable fragmentation and surface erosion. The material was mainly identified to cattle. The remains appear to be from adult animals. It is thought this pit was used for disposal of domestic refuse, possibly with some primary butchery waste.  Truncation at the site was so extensive no remains later than Roman date survived. A vegetable tempered sherd [017] could be Saxon however. There is high potential for for further to work to find Prehistoric features. It is clear the truncation was not as destructive as thought so the archaeological potential of similar sites should be viewed carefully.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

When significant archaeological horizons were encountered, the investigation was by hand by Museum of London Archaeology archaeologists.  Natural gravels were recorded at between 9.74m OD and 8.44m OD. These had been truncated. No natural deposits were observed within trenches 5 and 6. The earliest deposits identified observed were within Trench 1. These comprised reworked brickearth, clay and sandy silt which are thought to date to the Medieval period. These deposits may be fills of quarry pits. Intercutting quarry pits were found in Trench 3 and although the fills did not contain dating material they are thought to date to the Medieval period.  Post Medieval building foundations survive within the trenches and these can be related to late 19th Century cartographic sources, namely the Ordnance Survey maps of 1894 and the Goad Insurance Plan of 1887. The latter identifies the site as being occupied by warehouses with arched basements owned by Browne and Eagle's Wool and Pickfords Carriers.

Four test trenches were excavated, measuring between 6.08-6.90m long by 4.25-4.55m wide. A sondage was excavated in the centre of each trench down to a depth of 2.35-2.55m, measuring 2.65-4.10m long by 1.55-1.65m wide. Four geoarchaeological boreholes were taken by QUEST at the same time.  The general stratigraphy of the site comprised 0.18-0.20m thick of mid brown topsoil, which overlaid a layer of made ground 0.65-1.03m thick. In trenches 2 and 4 the made ground overlaid a layer of orange-blue alluvial clay (0.98-1.22m thick). In trench 3 this clay was overlain by black asphalt and red sand and in trench 1 by a blue-black peaty clay. Beneath the alluvial clay was a natural grey-orange gravels and appeared at a level of around 2.30m below the surface. These gravels did not appear in trench 1, possibly due to the level of excavation. In trench 4 the gravels appeared at a greater depth in the western end, at around 2.72m below the surface. The stratigraphy is believed to be attributed to flooding from the Pool River up until the late 19th Century when the site was developed. In the late 19th Century demolition rubble and waste was spread over the area to raise the level of the ground above flood levels. The land was subsequently used as Milton Sports Ground until the late 20th Century. The asphalt may relate to an attempt to develop the land before levelling the land with demolition materials to create the sports ground.

It was concluded that there was low potential for archaeological remains relating to Prehistoric settlement, a low potential for Roman remains (despite the presence of a Roman road in the vicinity), a low potential for Saxon and Medieval remains, and a low potential for Post Medieval and modern remains.  Cartographic sources show the site within an agricultural landscape until the 1942 OS map. By the 1955 OS map a garden and swimming pool have been built on the north-eastern part of the site. The Croydon Water Palace occupied the western area site by 1991, while the eastern part was a car park. The site was redeveloped in 2003 with a leisure park and associated parking constructed. An archaeological evaluation on the site in 1998 showed that the site had been terraced during the construction of the car park and this removed any shallow features present. No archaeological deposits or features were recorded.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Five evaluation trenches were excavated on the site, measuring c.13-20m x 2m x up to 1.5m deep. Trenches were excavated by machine and monitored by a Museum of London Archaeology supervisor.  Small pockets of brickearth were identified dealing the underlying gravels at c.19.63-19.80m OD. The rest of the brickearth had been truncated and/or worked and redeposited. The pockets were trial excavated by hand.  It was found that archaeological deposits, where they do survive, were at an average depth of c.0.40m to 0.50m below modern ground level. These were sealed below modern made ground and disturbed historic soils and made ground.  The mid 19th Century remains of 13-27 Bath Road are partially extant with some walls and floors surviving in situ. These buildings will have truncated earlier archaeological remains.

A varied geoarchaeological assessment was undertaken on a representative borehole to gain a more detailed understanding of the sediments sampled across the site. Fieldwork comprised drilling a series of five terrier rig boreholes (MoLBH1-5) across the site.  The results of the assessment showed that the site shares stratigraphic and environmental similarities with other sites across the Greenwich Peninsula. Modelling of the early Holocene or Mesolithic topography indicates the site initially occupied an area dominated by a channel feature in the Pleistocene floodplain gravels which later infilled with early Holocene sands and clays followed by peats, estuarine muds and finally, modern made ground.  Analysis of the peat in particular indicated an alder dominated fenland dominated the site from the early Neolithic and, although no direct evidence was found on the site of human occupation, indirect evidence of human activity was recorded in the form of cereal pollen following the opening up of the environment from the later Prehistoric.  The assessment of the sediments sampled has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the changing palaeoenvironment within the site during the Holocene which is in line with other geoarchaeological investigations in the area. In the light of the revised understanding of the geoarchaeological potential of the site however, the report recommends no further work.",

Sutton Archaeological Services were responsible for monitoring the test pitting and bore hole survey conducted by Foundation and Exploration Services. The site lies along the south bank of the Thames between Chelsea and Vauxhall bridge. The site, split into two, held two important functions from 1840 onwards, one as the site of the Pumphouse of Lambeth and Vauxhall Water Works and from the 1920's onwards the other half became the site for the Battersea Power Station. Of the 37 test pits excavated it showed that the potential for archaeological survival had been removed. Exceptions lay to the east and south east where the natural gravel terraces were found to have survived above level OD. The eastern test pits suggest that by the amount of alluvial found there overlying the gravel this was pre-1862 period when the area was a market garden containing a well known agricultural industry. The bore holes produced some evidence for a possible ancient river channel running parallel to the Thames that silted up and allowed peat formation. Moreover of potential interest are the pollen samples. Due to the lack of work on pollen sequences in the Neolithic and Early Bronze Age in London there is space for these site samples to fill in some of the gaps present.

Four geoarchaeological boreholes were put down across the site.   This found a sequence of River Terrace Gravels (the Shepperton Gravel), overlain by floodplain deposits of Peat and Upper Alluvium (silts and clays) beneath the site. The nature of the sediments is relatively consistent across the site, and accumulated between the early Neolithic and late Bronze Age. Since this timeframe is represented by many local sites for which detailed records exist, no further palaeoenvironmental work is recommended. However, when compared with these other sites, the nature and age of the sediments is highly variable and therefore important.

There is also thought to be moderate potential for evidence of Post Medieval water management on the site: a late 19th Century overflow pond related to a Cocoa Fibre Works was located on the site. Additionally there is thought to be low to moderate potential for remains associated with Prehistoric explotation of resources along the Hogsmill River. The site has low potential for remains of all other periods.

This has resulted in the  suggestion of moderate potential for Prehistoric archaeology at the site. The site lies within the established boundary of the precinct of the Benedictine nunnery of St Mary Clerkenwell, established in the late 12th Century. This has resulted in a high potential for Medieval activity on the site. Evidence of agricultural/horticultural activity is considered to most likely.

Ten trenches were opened as part of the evaluation and an area around trench 3 was monitored as part of the watching brief. Each of the trenches was proposed to measure 15m x 1.8m and the watching brief area covered 20m x 7m. Initial excavation was conducted by a mechanical excavator and machine excavation the excavated in spits of 100mm.  Brickearth was found in five of the trenches at c.2.5m OD in the north of the site and c. 3.5m OD in the south. In trench 9, natural gravel was observed at 2.51m OD but no brickearth was encountered. In trenches 1, 2 and 6 no natural deposits were encountered and modern truncation was present to a depth of 2.4m below ground level. In trench 3 a possible Medieval layer was recorded at 3.36m OD.

Similarly there are very few remains dating to the Roman period in the area of the scheme, indicating that potential for Roman archaeology is also low. Foxley Lane was an established route by the later Medieval period but it is likely that its origins are considerably earlier. Therefore it is possible that the scheme may encounter remains associated with the historic route, although disturbance related to the modern carriageway is likely to be encountered.

The site was used as a rubbish dump in the late 19th cenutry which distrubed some of the later deposits.  River terrace gravels were seen to outcrop at a maximum height of 2.70m OD, shelving towards the present river at a slope of c.1.25m. On the western part of the site they were overlaid by a brickearth depoist up to 0.75m thick.  The earliest dated feature was a pit radicarbon dated to 8150+_ 60 BP (Neolithic Period). This however may be explained by contamination. Two shallow circular pits were recorded in the northern part of the site (contexts [022]-[025]) which were cut into the brickearth and contained struck flint and Peterborough Ware (Neolithic). They also contained a considerable quantity of burnt flint nodules and charcoal. These pits have been interpreted as cooking pits.  A ditch terminal and two futher pits [022, 024, 054, 055] yeileded worked flints and waste flakes attributable to the Neolithic to Bronze Age. Five further pits had large quantities of burnt flint and charcoal and were similar in form to the supposed cooking pits.  39 struck flints were found, the most diagnostic of which was a small convex scraper worked on the distal end of a cortical flake [054].  Grog tempered material from contex [022] includes at least two small Peterborough Neolithic bowls (Fengate Ware). Seven plant remian samples were collected from Prehistoric features. Five of these contained charred plant remains. Possible cereal grains were found in four samples from fills [024], [052] and [054]. The grain in [024] was tentatively identified as barley. Small quantities of hazlenut shell were found in sample residues from pitfills [022] and [024]. Wood charcoal was also noted. Uncharred seeds including goosefoot and elder were found in fills [024] and [050] together with wood.  In the southern part of the site a layer of firm waterlaid silt clay up to 180mm thick extended over the area of axcavation. This seals one cooking pit but is cut by two others.  A residual scatter of Roman ceramic building material and pottery was recovered.  At the southern end of the site an isolated inhumation burial was found. This grave was aligned east-west and the head lay to the west. AMS dating of the skeltal material was revealed a date of AD450-820 (uncal date was 1380+/- 80 BP, which gives a date of AD560-720 or 740-760 at 68.2% confidence of AD450-820 at 95.4%). The bone was poorly preserved and all traits used to determine osteological sex were very eroded, fragmented or damaged. The individual is probbaly male and a fully mature adult.  Pre-15th Century tiles were recovered from the upper sandy deposit sealing the Saxon burial.  A deposit of apparently riverworked sand and silt contained finds of Medieval date and may have sealed the aforementioned burial. This deposit was cut by a series of shallow trenches running north to south parallel to the line of the modern river. These were sealed with a deposit of brick rubble; possibly this acted as an area of hardstanding next to the river. Drainage ditches were laid out to the west of the site, possibly marking an area of cultivation.  110 fragments (1.17kg) of animal bone were recovered from possibly waterlaid contexts dating to the Medieval, early and late Post Medieval periods.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

This covered the proposed Cycle Hire docking station on the footway opposite No. 2 King Edward Street (north-west of the junction with Angel Street). The docking station site lies within an Archaeological Priority Area. A search of the Greater London Historic Environment Record identified a total of 182 archaeological sites, findspots and monuments within a 150m study area around the proposed docking station site.   Two Scheduled Monuments are located within 20 metres of the site, and while there is no evidence of significant archaeological activity within the site, the surrounding area is dotted with archaeological activity. There is considered to be a high potential for encountering significant archaeological activity dating to the Roman period onwards. The likely impact from the proposed foundations upon known and potential below ground archaeological deposits are considered to be fairly minimal.

This event relates to the watching brief element, see ELO13426 for the standing building survey record. This involved monitoring of redevelopment works whilst also creating a photographic building record. The work was undertaken between 2009 and 2011. King's Cross Station was built as the London terminus of the Great Northern Railway in 1852 to designs by Lewis Cubitt. At the time of its construction the principles behind the design and layout of large passenger terminals were yet to be fully established. Cubitt's designs provided the GNR with an efficient and simple layout to the station buildings and an uncomplicated yet striking public faÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ade, made all the more significant by its contrast to the palatial Gothic of St Pancras Station, which opened later in 1868. The Western Range building at King's Cross was the working heart of the station, housing the Booking Hall, waiting rooms and refreshment rooms for the public as well as board rooms, office rooms, strong rooms and the Parcel Office. The building also contained large storage facilities in the basement for food, beer and wine, whilst attic areas were utilised to house large water tanks for fresh water. The historic building recording included a watching brief on the redevelopment and refurbishment of the Western Range allowing hiden features to be recorded. The majority of the demolition occurred internally, with selected partition walls, floors and fireplaces being removed. The opening up and enabling works exposed much of the buildings fabric, structure and details which were examined and analysed as and when feasible. These elements were then interpreted and appropriately recorded, having regard to their historical and architectural significance.",A GIS polygon was created around the site boundary at a scale of 1:1500 using OS MasterMap as a base

Nine samples were taken from the most suitable looking timbers and cross matching was found between some of the series. No consistent matching was found when comparing with dated reference material and the site therefore could not be dated dendrochronologically.

The buildings comprised the gatehouse and adjoining buildings.  The survey included the examination, recordings and analysis of the fabric of the buildings as well as documentary research, dendrochronology, historic paintwork analysis and a consideration of the function and significance of the buildings.  The gatehouse is dated to 1684, by an inscription on its street faÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ade, and comprises six storeys within a brick shell with timber floor frames and roof frame. The street faÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ade has a classical design. The two side windows on the first floor are among the first French windows built in England. The internal rooms are panelled; much of the panelling appears to have been reused and is dated to the late 17th and 18th Centuries. Oak timbers from the gatehouse were sampled for dendrochronology, which has revealed felling dates of the early 1680s. Analysis of paint samples from panelling in the gatehouse indicate the initially these rooms were painted white with coloured paint only being applied at the end of the 18th or beginning of the 19th Centuries.  The east range of buildings adjoining the gatehouse is dated to 1693. The building has six storeys and consists of brick chimney stacks and mainly timber framed walls with the upper floors being jettied out to the west at the first and second floor levels This form of construction is unusual for the date and appears to contravene the London Rebuilding Act 1667.

The scheme comprises the demolition of the existing buildings from the 1940s and 1960s and redevelopment of the site to provide a single storey basement, together with ground plus ten storey building. The proposed mix of uses would include 420sqm (GEA) of flexible office and retail floorspace at ground floor level (falling within Use Classes B1/A1-A5) and 4,658 sqm (GEA) of office floorspace (Use Class B1), along with cycle parking provision, plant and storage, and other works incidental to the proposed development. The existing basement would be deepened within the existing basement footprint. The foundations would be piled. The site does not lie within an Archaeological Priority Area or a Conservation Area. This desk-based study assesses the impact on buried heritage assets (archaeological remains). Although above ground heritage assets (historic structures) are not discussed in detail, they have been noted where they assist in the archaeological interpretation of the site. Buried heritage assets that may be affected by the proposals comprise:  Post Medieval remains. There is a low to moderate potential for features associated with the 18th Century or later buildings previously within the site, including wall foundations, wells and rubbish or cess pits. Any such remains would be of low heritage significance. Prior to being developed the site may have been used for gravel extraction. Any evidence of gravel pits would be of low significance.  Roman remains. There is a low to moderate potential for evidence of Roman activity. Isolated finds has been recorded within the study area, while a major Roman road is thought to have run to the north of the site. The site may have been under cultivation during this period. Roman agricultural remains would be of low to medium significance. Isolated and redeposited Roman finds would be of low significance. The site has a low potential for buried heritage assets of other periods. The site would have been a suitable location for settlement in the Prehistoric period, located on the well-drained gravel terrace close to the River Thames. However, there is no archaeological evidence for Prehistoric activity in the vicinity of the site. Throughout the early and later Medieval periods the site was probably in open fields away from known areas of settlement. Archaeological survival is likely to be high outside the footprints of the existing basement in the northeastern and south-western parts of the site, and moderate to high within the footprint of the existing basement, which comprise c 80% of the site footprint. The proposed breaking out floor slab at ground floor and basement levels would truncate or remove entirely any archaeological remains directly beneath the slab. The proposed basement excavation would truncate and remove any Post Medieval and Roman remains, possibly apart from the bases of deeply cut features, such as wells, pits or ditches. Piled foundations, including pile caps, ground beams, and below slab services and drains, along with lift pits, would remove entirely any surviving remains within the footprint of each construction. In light of the generally low potential of the site to contain significant archaeological assets, it is considered unlikely that preliminary archaeological field evaluation of the site either pre- or postdetermination of planning consent would be necessary or required. However, an archaeological watching brief would be required during preliminary ground preparation and subsequent basement construction, which would ensure that any previously unrecorded archaeological assets are not removed without record. Alternatively the archaeological monitoring of any geotechnical investigations could clarify the nature and depth of deposits, and based on the results no further work may be necessary. Any archaeological work would need to be undertaken in accordance with an approved Written Scheme of Investigation (WSI) and could be carried out under the terms of a standard archaeological planning condition set out under the granting of planning consent.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Additionally there is a moderate potential for later Medieval remains associated with the priory of the Order of St John. The site was situated on the western edge of the outer precinct of the priory (founded in the mid 12th Century). There is also a moderate potential for alluvium of the River Fleet, which may contain palaeoenvironmental remains.

The first phase comprised red brick cellar walls, which outlined a square double-pile house. During the second phase the original east cellar wall was cut back and pushed out, the west side was partially rebuilt and bays added to the north and south. This was during the re-fronting and extension of the building in 1828-29. Features recorded within the cellar showed that the south-west room formed a coal cellar and the adjoining barrel-vaulted room was consistent with a wine store or muniment room. This room was given an additional damp-proofing brick skin to the exterior.  Internal partitions were formed of brick dwarf walls with timber partitions above.

It was found that there is particular potential for remains associated with the Roman to 17th Century City gate (Aldgate) as well as the Roman and Medieval city walls and/or the defensive ditch. There may also be remains associated with the main Roman settlement, extramural industrial activity and burials. Additionally there is potential for evidence of Saxon to Medieval domestic and industrial activity as well as features associated with the earlier St Botolphs Church.  Previous archaeological investigations have uncovered archaeological remains at relatively high levels beneath the modern ground surface, in some cases directly beneath the modern road-base.  The construction of the London Underground will have truncated any archaeological deposits in large parts of the study area. The construction of pedestrian subways will also have removed archaeology from the study area.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Two geotechnical test pits were located within the basement of the exisiting property. The Test pits revealed the truncated remains of two Roman pits cut into the underlying natural deposits, the truncated surface of the latter was apparent at c. 0.95 m OD. Test pit 1 was 1.00m square and excavated to a depth of 1.20m. Within the test pit mortar, tile, oyster shell and one fragment of Roman pottery was recorded. The pit was construed to be the remnant of a deep cess or rubbish pit of the Roman period. A modern intrusion had been cut through this, into the natural sand beyond the base of the test pit. The intrusion was most likely associated with the construction of the piers of the existing building. Test pit 2 was 1.25m by 1.00m and dug to a depth of 1.25m. It revealed a heavily truncated sequence of deposits which bore a similarity to those within the first test pit. One sherd of Roman pottery was present in the pit fill, context [1]. It was a fragment of a base of a beaker, probably an imported ware likely to have had an origin in the region of central Gaul. The side of the vessel bore evidence of white barbotine decoration.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.
