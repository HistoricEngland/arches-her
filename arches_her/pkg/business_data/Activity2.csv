These were mainly associated with Price's Candle Factory and its successors.  An archaeological evaluation consisting of 5 trenches. Natural deposits were only encountered within sondages in Trenches 1 and 2 in the southern part of the site. Natural sand and gravel found in Trench 1 was consistent in character with Kempton Park gravels and was overlain by alluvial clay. Potential alluvium was also found in Trench 2. These alluvial deposits were likely to be associated with the Falcon Brook which existed now in a sewer immediately to the south of the site. All five trenches were found to contain structures associated with the Price's Candle Factory and its successors, dating from the 19th-20th Century, including soakaways, floor surfaces, extensive wall foundations, large basements and layers containing industrial waste. The only deposit that pre-dated the Price's Factory Complex encountered during the evaluation other than the natural alluvium and sand and gravel was a layer composed of possible postmedieval homogenous dumped deposits.

All the buildings, except that in Devonshire Row, are to be wholly or partly demolished, and the building in Stone House Court, which is statutorily listed grade II, will be reconstructed. An archaeological investigation and a subsequent report were required as a condition of planning, listed building and conservation area consent for the redevelopment. The investigation took place in April and May 2011. The buildings to the north on the site, in Devonshire Row and Devonshire Chambers, were built in 1878-9, soon after construction by the cut-and-cover method of an underground railway line running from west to east across that part of the site. Devonshire Chambers was designed by Benjamin Tabberer for the Metropolitan Railway Co Ltd. The remaining buildings to the south were built after the land, or leases, there were sold for redevelopment in 1923. Stone House was designed by Richardson and Gill (Sir Albert Richardson and Charles Gill), architects, in 1926 and completed in 1928, while Staple Hall, by the same architectural practice, was completed in 1931. The intention at that time was to create a shopping precinct in a new pedestrian street, Stone House Court, and a Regency-style shop front was built at No 1 Stone House Court to designs by Richardson and Gill around 1931-33. Subsequently the part of the building immediately to the east of this, at Nos 3 and 5 Stone House Court, was refronted to match the Regency-style shop front.",

Two main elements of construction were observed - the Sports Hall itself and an access road. For the latter, a strip of ground about 50 m long and about 6 m wide was topsoiled to a maximum depth of 300 mm. The topsoiling revealed undisturbed natural deposits, previously truncated by the earlier terracing. There was no trace of any archaeological deposit, soil, feature or find. The relative levels ranged from 99.80m to 104.40m.  For the Sports Hall, together with the fire-access facility, parking and play-areas, a level platform some 80x35m was required. The area was mechanically reduced by the contractors progressively from the west. This reduction increased in depth from about 0.20m to a maximum of 1.20m (relative levels 99.54m to about 100.78m). The whole process was watched by the Unit, with some 300mm of topsoil being first removed and stacked. This process again exposed the largely undisturbed natural deposits, here clay and pebble beds, as cut bv the terracing which had taken place in the 1960s.

The survival, extent and date of the buried Quebec Dock is unknown, but this will have had a major impact on all other archaeological deposists within its footprint. Bomb damage from World War II and the cuttings for the foundations of the buildings currently on site will havehad a further localised impact. Nevertheless, there is a high potential for archaeological deposits to survive in some areas of the site.

An archaeological evaluation in 2008 identified Roman and Post Medieval deposits  within the proposed basement, therefore the London Borough of Southwark advised that there would have to be full excavation in this area. A scheme of archaeological excavation in two phases was developed and approved by London Borough of Southwark.  The first phase of excavation (written scheme of investigation, Seeley 2010) took place between 22 November 2010 and 11 April 2011 and involved 12 trenches located in new pile locations for the new building. An intermittent watching brief on the secant wall located in the area of the Post Medieval graveyard continued until 7 May 2011.There was a break in the archaeological investigation, during which piling for the new building took place, a secant pile wall being built around the perimeter of the new basement, and the casting of the new ground floor slab.  The second phase of excavation took place between 10 October 2011 and 22 February 2012 within the new basement. This involved an initial watching brief of ground reduction to allow access to the new basement. This was followed by excavation of any surviving archaeological deposits that were located between the previous trenches.   Natural sand and gravels were at c 0.50m OD across most of the site with waterlain deposits to the east showing the influence of the nearby 'Guy's Channel' and evidence of some Late Bronze age activity taking place. The earliest Roman activity was two timber-lined wells and a series of quarry pits containing large amounts of domestic pottery. This was followed in the AD 2nd Century by two substantial masonry buildings, the foundations of the easternmost being constructed of chalk. Both of these had areas of tessellated floors and had been remodelled with the insertion of hypocausts. Demolition dumps sealed these buildings, and four burials assumed to be of late Roman date cut into the top of these deposits.  Some of the masonry walls had been robbed and in places there were significant deposits of 'dark earth'. Significant Roman finds include glass waste and cullet and an inscribed stone base referring to the god Silvanus.  Along the southern boundary, there was further evidence for the 16th-Century burial ground associated with St Thomas' Hospital, found during piling and previously excavated in 1991 (NLB91, Jones 1991). No in situ burials of this period were found but disarticulated human bone was removed for later reburial.  Occupational activity of 16th- to 17th Century date was found across the site in various dumps, pits and two barrel-lined pits. One double cesspit contained fragments of Delftware plates and other pits three wooden bowling balls and three fragments of Tudor terracotta mouldings. This was followed in the 18th/19th Centuries by garden soil deposits and brick features including walls, drains and wells/soakaways. With the possible exception of a large brick culvert, no remains could be identified as being from the early 19th Century remodelling of St Thomas' Hospital. To the north there was a substantial road surface made up of granite setts, which is probably associated with the late 19th Century remodelling around London Bridge station.  *Natural sands and gravels were observed at between c 0.5m OD and 0.65m OD. These had been removed in the east of the site (trench 6) by a tributary of Guy's Channel exposing clay at c 0.0m OD.*",

Four boreholes, seven window samples and six test pits were excavated.  The results of the investigations revealed a sequence of Lynch Hill Gravel, overlain by a thin (<0.6m thick) and patchily present horizon of silty, clayey sand, and Made Ground. The natural gravels were recorded slightly higher in the eastern part of the site, between 27.40m and 26.98m aOD, sloping slightly downwards to the west, where it was recorded between 27m and 26.60m aOD. The material overlying the Lynch Hill Gravel in eight of the sixteen interventions is predominantly sandy, lacks the features typical of 'brickearth' structure, and contained no evidence of calcium carbonate reprecipitation. On this basis, although a separate unit can be identified overlying the Lynch Hill Gravel at the site, it seems most likely that this unit is the product of disturbance and mixing affecting near surface deposits, and probably incorporating both Lynch Hill material and remnants of the Langley Silt. In addition, these deposits are thin, patchily present, and are probably truncated in places by the overlying Made Ground. The Palaeolithic archaeological potential of the site is therefore considered to be negligible, and no further investigation of these sediments is recommended.",

This archaeological fieldwork has confirmed the initial evaluation assessment that during the Roman period or earlier the Walbrook stream ran north-south across the site, becoming more shallow and marsh-like to the east. Later Roman activity, probably from the 2nd-3rd Centuries AD, consisted of probable refuse disposal, possibly in a gradual attempt at land reclamation. Medieval activity seems to have been limited to the eastern edge of the site, in the form of drainage channels. Late 19th/early 20th Century brickwork and rail lines, probably from Metropolitan Line construction were uncovered under the former basement of 11-12 Blomfield Street.  The archaeological work on site consisted of three separate interventions: an excavation in the area of the grout shaft, a targeted watching brief on the area of the main box, and a general watching brief during ground reduction of the rest of the site.  The excavation of the grout shaft area was done in two phases to record a full east-west profile across the shaft. The intention of this excavation was to explore the results seen in the evaluation, which uncovered the eastern edge of the main channel of the Walbrook. During the excavation, the channel was successfully recorded across the width of the trench. Natural sand and gravels were seen at the base (106.60m ATD) followed by a sequence of slow sedimentation, an early Roman marsh, quick episodes of sedimentation caused by flooding, and then Roman reclamation in the late 2nd Century topped by further marshy deposits combined with more Roman dumping/reclamation.  The targeted watching brief in the south-west portion of the main box recorded a probable continuation of the width of the Walbrook channel, filled with Roman reclamation dumping, and containing a later Roman ditch.  In the south-east corner of the site, the targeted watching brief recorded natural terrace gravels at a much higher level (108.33m ATD) than in the grout shaft, suggesting this would have been dryer ground near the edge of the Walbrook. An east-west running ditch cut into the subsoil and underlying natural terrace gravels is dated to the 11th/12th Century by pottery found within the fills. This was in turn cut by a north-south running ditch. These may represent Medieval attempts to drain the higher ground to the east into the Walbrook that ran along the western edge of the site.  The general watching brief on ground reduction across the rest of the site revealed late 19th/early 20th Century brickwork and rail lines in the northern portion of the site, probably from the Metropolitan Line.  *Natural gravels were observed at between 6.6m OD and 8.3m OD.*",

The sewer and structures were to be removed or altered in order to redevelop the site. The investigation of the structures took place periodically from March through to November 2007. The section of Northern Outfall Sewer which falls within the Olympic development site includes with the Greenway Bridge over the River Lea, the Greenway Bridge over Marshgate Lane and Pudding Mill Lane, the Pedestrian Subway, Abbey Lane Pedestrian Bridge, the Pedestrian Bridge spanning the Channelsea River and the Pedestrian Viaduct of the Outfall Sewer. These elements were recorded, researched and analysed.  The oldest structural remains date to the initial outfall sewer construction period of the late 1850s and early 1860s. The construction of the sewer was triggered by a series of public health crises in London, culminating in the 'Big Stink of London' in the late 1850s, and occurred as a direct result of the formation of the Metropolitan Board of Works. Their head engineer, Joseph Bazalgette, oversaw the construction of the sewer. The rising population of the area served by the sewer over the following decades necessitated the 1904-05 expansion of the section from Old Ford to Barking by two extra sewer pipes on the northern side. The following years saw little in the way of major alteration, being a period of maintenance and repair rather than large scale works. The years 1940-41 saw the sewer become a casualty of German bombs, but despite numerous hits little real damage was done and the structure was repaired. The post-war period saw very little change for the sewer until the late 1980s, when efforts to construct and maintain green areas in and around London resulted in the renovation of the footpath on the sewer embankment to create the Greenway, a footpath and cycle route.",

The slabs forming the path are known to cover brick burial vaults and some (although not the slab in question) retain lettering on their surface from original inscriptions relating to the occupants of the vaults.  Two smaller paving slabs to the south of the loose slab were lifted by the contractor and vault slab raised using a machine. Beneath it was a sand and silt bedding layer over a concrete slab 150mm thick, and although narrower north-south than the vault slab extended east and west beyond the limits of excavation and possibly underlay the entire path in the vicinity. The movement of the paving slab was probably not caused by a weakness in the underlying concete, and it was proposed that the bedding layer be consolidated and the slab re-laid.

The aim of the excavation was to more fully investigate the features observed during the excavation of three trial trenches in February 1996. These features included a wooden revetment on the southern side of an east-west channel, provisionally dated to between the 13th and 17th Centuries, and possible Prehistoric features cut into the natural sand.  The excavation was conducted in two phases, due to limited space for spoil storage. The southern half of the site, Area 1, was excavated first, then backfilled, before the excavation of the northern half, Area 2. The total area excavated measured approximately 275m squared. The surface level of the adjacent road was at 4.4m aOD. The construction of an early 20th Century basement had resulted in the vertical truncation of the site by at least 3.2m. The surface of the basement slab was encountered at 1.8m aOD, and was itself 0.6m thick. A natural deposit of yellow sand with brown mottling was encountered throughout the site at between 0.13m and 0.39m aOD.  The earliest features encountered on the site comprised a range of Prehistoric agricultural features. A sandy ploughsoil extended over the entire site. A series of north-south and east-west aligned intercutting grooves at the southern end of Area 1 were cut into the natural and filled by a similar material to the ploughsoil above. These grooves were between 0.05m and 0.07m in width, 0.03m to 0.05m in depth and had a maximum length of 1.2m, with a V-shaped profile. These were interpreted as ard marks, similar to those found nearby at Phoenix Wharf and Wolesley Street. Four stake holes were also identified in Area 1, cutting the natural sand and containing fills similar to the ploughsoil above, suggesting they were cut from this layer and are of a similar date to the ard marks. 9 fragments of burnt flint and 6 worked flints were recovered from this layer in Area 2, while the same layer in Area 1 produced 10 fragments of burnt flint, 21 struck flints and 2 pottery sherds. One of the pot sherds was dated to the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age, while the struck flints included a possible Early Neolithic leaf arrowhead roughout and a possible knife. The ploughsoil was radiocarbon dated to the Middle Bronze Age, between 1520 BC and 1220 BC.  Cutting into this ploughsoil in Area 1 was a ditch, 3.0m wide and 0.45m deep with stepped in sides, which appeared to delineate the extent of, but also truncate, the ard marks, suggesting a field boundary which was later recut. A smaller ditch or gully, roughly 0.40m wide, ran roughly northwest-southeast through the ard marks and joined the larger ditch at its northern end, but the relationship between these features is unclear. In Area 2, two possible post-holes,  0.2m in diameter with a depth of 0.14m, cut the ploughsoil layer, while two larger circular flat-based features of unknown purpose were also identified. All of these features were filled and sealed by a layer of peat, representing rising water levels and a period of disuse. 8 struck flints (including an adze butt and an adze sharpening flake, usually regarded as Mesolithic) and 4 sherds of Roman pottery were recovered from the peat layer.  In the Medieval period, the natural channel in the south of the site was recut, and a wooden bridge was built spanning it. Two building phases of the bridge were identified. The earlier phase comprised two parallel timbers on either side of the channel, connected by three north-south aligned timbers.The east-west timbers contained grooves, possibly designed to hold vertical posts. Fragments of planking were found to the north and south of the channel, which would have been placed horizontally against its edge and held in place with wooden stakes. Two sandy clay deposits then built up around these timbers, after which three additional north-south timbers were placed above the earlier structure. These contained two grooves to hold strengthening braces, giving additional support to the planking on the sides of the channel. After a further silty clay and gravel deposit, the final phase involved an east-west aligned transverse plate on the northern side, with two mortises cut into its souther side to accommodate two north-south aligned longitudinal plates, which were truncated to the south. One of these contained grooves for braces. This phase would have been much more self-stable, as opposed to the earlier structure which required modification for bracing. Dendrochronological dating of the timbers indicated a 13th Century date for the construction of the bridge. An east-west aligned early Post Medieval gully in the northern part of Area 1 is also associated with this group.  From the early Post Medieval period onwards, alluvial deposits represent repeated flooding of the area. In the northern part of Area 1,further alluvial deposits with sandy lenses overlay the more homogenous alluvial clay up to a depth of 1.74m aOD. These layers are finally overlain by the destruction layer associated with the construction of the basement in the early 20th Century, which has truncated any other archaeological deposits.",

The archaeological monitoring of the foundation excavation, Trench 1 (12.63m by 4.90m), revealed that there had been significant truncation of underlying natural clay deposits, probably caused by terracing and construction works in the first half of the 20th century. This assertion was supported by the presence of modern made ground deposits directly overlying the natural clay. No archaeological features or deposits were encountered during the archaeological investigation. Because of the extent of truncation and the absence of any potential for archaeological survival across the rest of the site, it was agreed with the archaeological advisor to the London Borough of Harrow that continuation of the archaeological watching brief was not necessary beyond those areas encompassed by Trench 1 that had already been monitored.  * Naturally deposited clay was seen in the northern half of the trench and was encountered at heights between 81.88-82.23m OD.*",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

This phase of evaluation comprised three test pits, TP5, STP1 and STP3 in the carpark area of the development area.  Test pit 5 initally overlay a backfilled brickwalled basement of 19th Century date. The basement was subdivided, beneath one, 17m down, just beneath a floor was a brick built culvert of yellow stock brick. The other side of the divide continued down 2.3m and continued below the JCB's full reach.  STP 1 This was located against the upstanding red-brick wall which bounded the open area to the south. This continued down to basement level, with its construction backfill on the north side, some 0.8m wide. It cut down through levelling deposits to 15.6m OD (2.1m below ground level). Below it was an undated layer of made ground, which was not bottomed, but was  over 300mm deep.  STP3 was located near the western end of car park, 6m to the west ofTP4. No walls of any period were observed. Directly below the concrete slab was a homogeneous deposit, 1.8m deep, of dark-grey with frequent fragments of brick and tile. This was different in character from the rubble backfill in TP5 and looked more like a large-scale dumping rather than a rubble basement backfill. Withinthe material on the west side of the test-pit was a north-south orientated shallow culvert, composed of red bricks bonded in soft cream-coloured mortar. The bricks were unfrogged and appeared to be 18th Century in date.  A group of test-pits within the standing building were excavated by contractors in the basement of Weddel House. They were dug to depths within the range 1.1m to 2.0m. All pits revealed nothing other than natural sands and gravels. Included in this part of the programme was another test-pit dug below the floor slab of the void basement to the north of TP3 in the northern external area. Below the concrete was 1.1 m depth of silty gravel with a few brick fragments; this was homogeneous in all four sections ofthe test-pit, and is interpreted as make-up/debris from the construction of the standing building.  Summary of all evaluation work. A partially-excavated feature cut from the level of natural gravel as probably a 1st Century quarry pit. A chalk-lined cellar of presumed Medieval date was destroyed and replaced with a substantial but shallowly-founded north-south orientated wall of suggested 16th Century date, which included re-used mouldings possibly from the aissolved Priory ofSt Bartholomew's. This wall was in turn cut through by an east-west mason(y foundation bottomed on n~tural gravel. Some 19th Century fire debris was cut through by a brick wall on shallow chalk foundations, forming the southwestern corner of a building. To the west of these findings were deep intercutting cess-pits of Medieval/early Post Medieval date.  *The Natural gravel was observed at 15.55m OD in TP3.*",

The proposed development involves the demolition of 20th Century Titchfield House and the 19th Century Picture House and the construction of two new office buildings to replace them with double basements, whilst the townhouses on Tabernacle Street and Old Street will be renovated and extended. The scheme will also include the creation of a new public courtyard at the centre of the site.  Buried heritage assets that maybe affected by the proposals are remains dating to the Post Medieval period, most particularly the development on the site from the 18th Century onwards. Evidence of quarrying could survive in the form of large extraction pits, together with building foundations and any historic basements/cellar, along with rubbish and cesspits in their backyards. The significance of such remains would be low, as derived from their evidential and historical value. Whilst the precise location of the Civil War Defences is not known, archaeological remains relating to the defences (ditches/ramparts) are considered to be unlikely on the site. However, if any such remains were present, they could be of medium or high significance, depending on their nature and extent. There is a low potential for surviving remains of all other periods.  Archaeological survival is likely to vary across the site. It is considered to be low to moderate in those areas which are basemented and moderate to high within other areas occupied by existing or earlier buildings dating from the late 18th Century onwards. Outside of these areas, specifically the former Short Street and the back gardens of the terraced properties, archaeological survival is predicted to be high. Quarry pits have been found across the study area and it is likely that these could have occurred within the site, removing all earlier remains within their footprint. The main impact of the proposed development on the site will be the creation of new double basements for the new buildings within the footprints of Titchfield House and Picture House and a new single level basement at 95-109 Great Eastern Street. These works would result in the complete or almost complete truncation of any underlying archaeological remains.  The site is within an Archaeological Priority Area; however, the site has a low archaeological potential for all periods, except for Post Medieval remains of low significance.

The Royal London Hospital was founded on Whitechapel Road in 1752 according to a design by Boulton Mainwaring. The East and Wings were added to the pre-existing Front Block in 1775 and 1778 respectively by the architect Edward Hawkins and enclosed a garden to the rear of the Front Block. The Wings were 6 bays long and two storeys high. They were later extended during the 1830s to a design by A.R.Mason and sanitary towers were added by Charles Barry Jun. during the 1860s and 1870s. Further remodelling of the south ends of each wing was undertaken by Rowland Plumbe between 1896-1906 and two extra floors were added. The continuous alterations throughout the 18th and 19th Centuries maintained a homogenous architectural concept of two identical muted classical style buildings of 6:3:7 bays long, on five floors with a basement, constructed in brick with flat gauged arched windows with double-hung sashes. The purpose of the wings was for patient wards, a function which was retained throughout their use-age, although the East Wing also contained specialist clinics.

During the 1960s both wards were modernised, the interior was gutted and a central corridor was laid out removing the central spine wall and dividing ancillary rooms and private rooms from larger wards.  From the late 1870s the hospital was extended to the south and many new buildings were added across a 40 acre site bounded by Whitechapel Road to the north, Cavell Street to the east, Newark Street to the south and New Road. Freestanding clinical structures such as Fielden House (1901) were built throughout the history of the hospital; however the pattern has more usually been one of adaption or rebuilding such as the Alexandra Wing (1978-82) which replaced an earlier building of the same name originally constructed in 1864-6. Fielden House was originally an isolation block and latterly a paediatrics unit and was brick-built on five floors plus basement and had purpose-built sanitary towers which exemplified the reforms in attempts to prevent epidemic at the time. The Alexandra Wing had projecting stock brick piers with a canted face dividing the windows and until 2011 served the hospital as an accident and emergency department complete with roof-top helicopter pad. The staff were also provided with a swimming pool in 1926. Ancillary buildings such as the Old Laundry (1904) and Estates Department (1909) were built to the south of Stepney Way.  There were also non-medical, private enterprises on land rented from the hospital such as a public house - the Oxford Arms (c.1869), and a clothing factory - the Garment Factory (c.1875-90).  The 20th Century saw a proliferation of new clinical structures constructed in such as the Link Block (1965), Holland Wing (1969), Garden House (1990-1) and the David Hughes Building (c.2002).",

The site is located within the Archaeological Priority Area of Bermondsey Lake, as designated by the London Borough of Southwark.  The study site is considered to have a low to moderate potential for archaeological evidence for the Prehistoric and Roman periods and a low archaeological potential for all other periods of human activity.  The construction of the modern building formerly occupying the study site, and its subsequent demolition as well as the construction of the access road to the rear can be considered likely to have had a severe, negative impact through the cutting of foundations and services and through landforming and ground levelling. Any agricultural or horticultural use of the study site prior to development can be considered to have had a widespread, moderate archaeological impact.  Redevelopment proposals currently comprise the construction of one block of residential flats, with a total building height of 4 storeys, and associated parking spaces, cycle storage and refuse storage on the basement level.  Owing to the footprint of the proposed development being largely situated within the footprint of the former buildings on site, it is anticipated that the redevelopment of the site will have a negligible archaeological impact.

Of the five trenches opened up, three revealed up to 4m of stratigraphy.The site was situated near the intersection of the north to south Roman road along present-day Bishopsgate with the Roman road passing east to west along the north side of the second basilica complex, roughly across the present Cornhill. No remains of either of these roads were uncovered. A large quarry had been dug in order to extract both brickearth and gravel. It appears likely to have been located in an open yard area.The heavily truncated remains of several mudbrick structures were located. The robbed foundations of a number of stone buildings were present; in one area, three phases of stone construction appear to have been robbed in the Roman period. The last of these consisted of a building with an apsidal end, which would have fronted onto the main north to south road. Elsewhere what may have been a broken crucible with quantities of liquid mercury rested on a hearth set on a floor which was sealed by a dump of Roman date. Where the Roman deposits were not truncated by later developments they were sealed by a mixed layer of what appeared to be garden soil and destruction rubble. This suggests that in the immediate post-Roman period the site was abandoned.When the site was occupied again the evidence suggests an open area, possibly at the back of properties or in a courtyard space, primarily employed for rubbish disposal from Early Medieval times to the 16th Century.

The research indicates that there is a low potential for significant Prehistoric archaeology on the site. In the Roman period the area close to the north of the city wall was used as a burial ground c.100m south-east of the site. Later in the Roman period the Moorfields marsh began to form, possibly due to the Walbrook becoming partially blocked. The subsequent marsh deposited alluvium over the Roman land surface. The potential for significant Roman archaeology on the site is considered to be low given its location away from the burial grounds and beyond the city wall.  During the Medieval period the site occupied the now fully formed Moorfields marsh. Following attempts to drain the area it was used for pasture. In the 13th Century the manor house 'Finsbury Court' was built the main buildings lying north of the site. The site lay in the southern part of the manor precinct and was occupied by a garden with a small building adjacent to Finsbury Pavement.  In the 18th Century the site was developed. On its western side a Chapel was built, possibly with a burial ground and further north the site was occupied by a distillery. A major redevelopment of the site took place in 1950s and again in the 1970s. Most of the site has existing basements and in some areas double depth basements although the northwest corner of the site has no basement. Archaeological survival is generally considered to be poor. The buildings on the site are fully occupied, and no archaeological evaluation will be possible until vacant possession in 2019.   The proposed development will include a 3 storey and 1 storey basement which will remove all earlier deposits. Excavations undertaken in 1978 have provided enough data for the potential of the site to be assessed. It is extremely unlikely that there are heritage assets of national or regional significance on the site. Heritage assets of local interest may be present.",

The site is located on what would have been low-lying intertidal marshland prone to flooding with the south-eastern third of the site possibly situated within a filled-in channel. The site has high potential for a sequence of alluvial deposits containing preserved pollen and other organic material which could provide evidence of past environments from the Prehistoric period onwards, of low or medium heritage significance.  There is a high potential for Post Medieval remains comprising land reclamation activities (ground consolidation deposits) and remains of late 17th Century and later buildings shown on historic maps such as wall footings, demolition deposits, cellars and garden soils which would be of low significance. The southern part of the site appears to have extended into the extensive 'Tan Yard', which was probably an area of tanning pits. The area was well known for this industry. There is potential for the remains of late 18th/early 19th Century tanning pits, potentially of medium heritage significance.  There is low or moderate potential for evidence of Prehistoric wetland resource exploitation within and beneath the underlying alluvium and likely well preserved due to waterlogged conditions. Investigations 30m to the north-east in 1989 revealed a circular pit containing an undated flint tool sealed by alluvium and peat. The significance of any such remains would depend on their nature and extent, but could be high.  The site was located some distance from the Roman settlement along Borough High Street, in intertidal marsh. There is low or moderate potential for evidence of wetland resource exploitation and for reclamation ditches, similar to one found 30m to the north-east of the site. The significance of any such remains would depend on their nature and extent, but could be high.  The construction of the existing garages would have had no impact on archaeological survival. The survival potential is expected to be high in localised areas of the site due to the absence of previous building development or buildings that are likely to have had basements. Elsewhere across the site the survival is anticipated to be moderate. In the eastern half of the site mid-19th Century terraces contained basements/cellars which will have removed any earlier deposits within their footprint to their formation level, although there is potential for alluvium to survive, along with any earlier remains within and beneath these deposits. Excavation for the proposed piled foundations would have an impact on any Post Medieval remains present but depending on the depth of the alluvial deposits and underlying gravels, in particular in the south-eastern third of the site within a possible channel, there is potential for early remains to survive below these works.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Lynch Hill Gravel deposits have been identified within the Site during geotechnical investigations at approximately 20.8m aOD. Lynch Hill Gravels are considered to be significant deposits having the potential to preserve early Palaeolithic archaeology and have been used to characterise developing Neanderthal behaviour in Britain. The proposed development is expected to impact onto the top section of the gravels with the finished level of the basement extension at 20.5m aOD. The proposed development will also include piled foundations to a maximum depth of 25m.  The site was located in the former Anglo-Saxon settlement known as Lundenwic and located in the London Suburb Archaeological Priority Area that was in part designated for the high potential for the recovery of Anglo-Saxon remains. Anglo-Saxon remains may survive at depth below the existing public footpath at High Holborn and Bloomsbury Street within the site boundary.  There is a high potential for the preservation of Post Medieval building remains in the study area beneath the modern buildings.  A moderate potential has been identified for the Romano-British period. A low potential has been identified for the Mesolithic to Iron Age period.,

It was decided to conduct a ground penetrating radar survey of both the projected line and the parch-marks to see which was a more likely candidate for the road. Two areas, one either end of the visible parch-mark were surveyed, each measuring 10m wide and 60m long.  In both cases the offset parch-mark produced a positive response showing signs of probable disturbance, whilst the projected route shown no evidence of disturbance.  The exercise was repeated over the faint parch-marks visible within the Roding Valley Park, to the North-east of Wanstead Park. These results were less successful due to interference from underlying clay geology, however no positive responses came from the projected road line.  It was therefore concluded that the parch-marks were a more likely candidate for the actual Roman Road and the disturbances seen may represent the ditches either side of the main road.

The watching brief monitored an excavation that started on Bridge Street, continued north along Parliament Street before turning east into Derby Gate. Excavations on Victoria Embankment were also monitored.  During the initial test pit monitoring, severe truncation to archaeological horizons was observed in the excavations at Parliament Street, Bridge Street and on Victoria Embankment (Trenches 1 to 4), as a result of service cuts. In the excavations at Derby Gate and Canon Row (Trenches 5 to 9), Post Medieval floors, walls, foundations and drains relating to the previous occupation of the area were observed, and works here were continuously monitored. The earliest findings were in Trench 5, were a Post Medieval ground raising horizon was cut by a 17th Century barrel well, in association with an east to west structural brick wall and floor surfaces. Such structures are represented on historic mapping such as the Morgan map of 1682 and the Rocque map of 1738. Later remains, dating to the mid 18th-19th Centuries, were also seen in Trench 5. A block of three terraces visible on the Horwood map of 1799-1819 was directly relatable to the structures observed.   The fact that, despite significant truncation, masonry remains from several periods survive at Derby Gate is notable, as intact earlier archaeological sequences may be sealed below these features and the earlier Post Medieval ground raising deposits. However, given the limited findings of the project, in terms of severe truncation and the limited impact of the scheme, Pre-Construct Archaeology considers that no further work is appropriate or necessary on this project.",

Following an evaluation in 2001 (ELO373), extensive refurbishment work was monitored on account of the western half of the site lying within the Scheduled Monument of the Roman Governor's Palace. Natural brickearth and gravels were cut by 1st or 2nd Century pits, including sand and gravel extraction pits. Late Saxon occupation was indicated by the presence of a single cesspit. Further pits are dated to the late Medieval period, including an unusually deep cesspit and a large stone-lined feature, the latter functioning as a cesspit in its final use but probably originally serving an industrial purpose. Pottery from the fills seems to indicate fairly high status ownership. The remains of a 17th-18th Century wall, a chalk-lined well and more cesspits, confirm the evidence that the area remained open as backyards to properties on Cannon Street and Lawrence Pountney Hill. Above these features the site was severely truncated by modern building construction.  *Natural deposits, consisting of brickearth and gravel (undifferentiated in the report) were recorded at a height of 10.13m OD*",

One evaluation trench measuring 9m long by 4m wide by 1.95m deep was excavated at the northern end of the site. The trench was stepped at a depth of 1 metre below the ground level to allow safe working access. On-site geoarchaeological work comprised auger holes through the base of the trench to recover the full Holocene sequence from the floodplain gravels up to the base of the trench. Modern ground level was at 2.97m OD.   Evidence for part of the southern downslope of the Horsleydown eyot (island) and palaeochannel was found on the site. The geoarchaeological study helped to inform on how natural topography of the local area has changed over the last 10,000 years. Initially the gravel surface, which approximates with the early Mesolithic land surface, indicated a slope into a deep Pleistocene channel, from -1.82m OD down to -4.4m OD. Over time, as environmental conditions changed and the channel became redundant, a peat developed across the site probably dated to the Bronze Age period. The upper alluvial clay deposits which inundated the peat were topped by a soil deposit dated to the Medieval period, though the ground was still marginal and prone to flooding.  Attempts at land reclamation and drainage management also began in the Medieval period and continued until the 17th/18th Century, when the land was used for agricultural purposes. In the later 18th/early 19th Century, a building was constructed on the area.  Due to the results of the archaeological evaluation exercise, relative low significance of the archaeological deposits recorded and low impact on any remains caused by piled foundations it is suggested that no further archaeological work is required at the site.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Merton Park was an early example of a Garden Suburb dating back to the 1870's. A conservation area map (adjacent) dating back to 1934 shows the site at 15 Langley Road containing the Coach House (detached garage) and garden land of a detached property at 78 Church Lane. Since this time the site has been sub-divided with a further detached dwelling built on Church Lane. The character assessment identifies the detached garage at 15 Langley Road as being built circa 1905 and designed by local architect John Sydney Brocklesby, who was heavily influenced by the Arts & Crafts movement. The existing bungalow is identified as being built around 1967 which is notably a year prior to the designation of the Merton Park Conservation Area.  The scale, character and materiality of the proposed dwelling is sympathetic to the architectural styles of the area's two key original architects - John Sydney Brocklesby, influenced by the Arts & Crafts style, and Henry Goodall Quartermain, influenced by the Queen Anne and Domestic Revival movement. It would therefore sit comfortably within the context of the Merton Park Conservation Area. In this context the proposal provides a much improved setting for the retained JS Brocklesby designed double garage.

Five boreholes were excavated to a maximum depth of 7m. Ground level was at 0.80m OD for boreholes 1 to 3, 0.50m OD for borehole 4 and 3.70m OD for borehole 5.  The results of the deposit modelling indicate that the sediments present beneath the site are similar to those recorded elsewhere in the Lower Thames Valley. A sequence of Shepperton Gravel is overlain by Holocene alluvial sediments, buried beneath modern Made Ground. The surface of the Gravel slopes downwards from north-west to south/south-east across the site, largely resting between -4 and -6m OD. The site clearly lies close to the floodplain/dryland edge, with Gravel surfaces typical of the Taplow Gravel terrace towards the northwest. A similar sequence of deposits is recorded across the neighbouring Beam Park site to the east. The Shepperton Gravel (and occasional sand) is overlain by a tripartite sequence of Lower Alluvium, Peat and Upper Alluvium. The Peat generally ranges between 1.5 and 3m in thickness, reaching over 3.5m in five records.  Significant Prehistoric archaeological remains have been found towards the top of the Peat close to the floodplain/dryland edge in the nearby vicinity. These finds include a Bronze Age causeway, constructed of gravel and burnt flint, stakes, spreads of fire-cracked pebbles, wattling and a brushwood trackway. There is therefore potential to find such remains at the Former Ford Stamping Factory site, particularly towards the northern/north-western edge of the site. Even in the absence of archaeological remains, the sediments recorded at the site have the potential to contain a wealth of further information on the past landscape, through the assessment/analysis of palaeoecological remains. It is recommended that a programme of environmental archaeological assessment is undertaken on one borehole at the site (QBH3), with radiocarbon dating of the base of the peat in borehole QBH1.",

The site has only a low potential for almost all archaeological periods, but a moderate potential for Prehistoric remains, specifically Bronze Age finds associated with the middle Bronze Age cremation cemetery known to lie 250m to the south. Although the site lies within the eastern extent of Central Acton Archaeological Priority Area, which is also known as Church Acton High Street (GLHER DLO35862) and relates to the Medieval settlement of Acton, only its eastern section and north-western corner lie within the  designated area.   The most notable heritage potential for the site relates to the extant former Acton County School in its eastern sector. The former county school building is locally listed and is significant in having been the first county school built by Middlesex County Council in 1906. Although not listed on the National Heritage List for England (NHLE), the building may be considered as being an undesignated heritage asset with some architectural significance. On brief external inspection, the building appears to survive in good condition and is a good example of Edwardian school architecture by a known architect at a time when such buildings often incorporated a number of styles resulting in eclectic yet well-designed buildings. Although not identified for demolition, further assessment may be considered appropriate to better understand its level of significance and to inform future management of an interesting historic school building.  Previous ground disturbance at the site is judged to be extensive and dating to the modern period. There is a significant probability that the development of the site as a college will have truncated and destroyed archaeological remains, if they existed within the site. The proposed development will have a high impact on archaeological remains, if preserved. The extant former Acton County School structure will remain.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

In addition, two proposed test pit positions (TPs 1-2) were window sampled due to the presence of a void between two concrete slabs, previously unidentified. Test pits were excavated both for the purposes of archaeological evaluation and in order to provide information on the nature and extent of existingfoundations and basement slabs.  The upper levels of three geotechnical boreholes (BH1-3) and a number of cores to assess slab depths were also monitored.  At the northern end of the site archaeological deposits were located dating to the Roman, Medieval and Post Medieval periods. Roman deposits were found in TP6, TP7 and TP8. For the most part these took the form of a series of horizontal layers. In TP6 a sequence of these deposits sealed a number of stake holes. In TP7 remains were found of a degraded surface as well as a dumped layer of painted wall plaster. A quarry pit cut was also found in the test pit.  Chalk walls forming part of a deep cess pit or well were found in TP8 and part of a chalk wall was also found in TP7. These features appeared to be Medieval in construction. A number of Medieval rubbish pits were found at the north end of the site, some of which contained dating evidence from the Early Medieval period dating to the 11 th to 12th Centuries.  In TP 10 part of a garden wall and two brick cesspits possibly dating to the 17th Century were found. In TP9 part of a Post Medieval brick wall of not earlier than 18th Century date was located. In the central and south western basement areas no archaeological deposits were encountered due to the depth of existing foundations, including a void between concrete slabs in the locations of TP 1 and TP2. In the car park area to the south- east, a soil horizon was located overlying natural brickearth and gravel in TP4. Truncated cut features were observed in TP3 and TP4. A variation in natural levels appeared to suggest the presence of a cut feature in BH 1, also in this area.  *Natural deposits were located across the site.

Recording was carried out in response to a planning condition for the redevelopment of the site and the demolition or partial demolition (facade retention) of the existing buildings.  Documentary research and building recording established that although the building at no. 1 Valentine Place was demolished in 2010, two date plaques with the date '1886' and initials of Charles Joseph Percival still survive at the south-west and south-east corners of the plot.  Percival operated as a 'provisions merchant and general contractor' from no. 1 Valentine Place in the late 19th Century. In addition, the south boundary wall of the plot once formed the south wall of the former late 19th Century buildings at no. 1 Valentine Place.  The west building at nos 3-5 Valentine Place appears to have been originally built between 1907 and 1916 when it replaced a row of small terraced houses at Angel Place. The 1937-38 and 1939 maps indicate that this building had a glass roof. Building analysis suggests that it was re-roofed with a saw tooth roof in the mid 20th Century. A first floor was added at the front (west) end of the building in the 1960s or 70s  The east building at nos 3-5 Valentine Place is a single storey warehouse constructed in 20th Century Fletton bricks. Map evidence suggests that it was built between 1958 and 1967. The building is late 1950s/early 1960s in appearance. The 1968 Goad plan shows that the buildings at nos 3-5 Valentine Place were a joinery run by Gaskell and Chambers, who made pub and bar fittings.  Documentary research and building recording shows that the building at nos 17-19 Valentine Place/no. 21 Webber Street was built or extensively re-built c.1907 and c.1910. The building replaced former terraced houses and a flour mill on the site. The building still retains some of the footprint of the former buildings on the site. The front elevation of the former terraced houses along Valentine Place and Webber Street was entirely replaced with a new facade in Edwardian neo-classical style fronting the Maltina Bakeries.  Maltina Bakeries Ltd was taken over by the Wonder Baking Company in 1948. In 1965 the building underwent a significant change of use when the Letraset Company took over. It was during the 1960s and 1970s that most of the present layout may have been established on the ground floor. After Letraset left in the early 1980s, the building was subleased to various small businesses and modern plasterboard partitioning was installed.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Brick vaults in floor area: York stone slabs survive around area of floor that has been removed - this was of timber.  Central area as exposed very unstable due to obvious presence of inhumations.  On the east side of the church, brick arched entrances give access to vaulted areas beneath central aisle, east aisle and chancel area.  Corresponding entrances must exist for the west side aisle but were not visible.  The vaults appear to be entirely built of yellow stock brick (London Stock), the bricks are in good condition and are bonded together with a pale grey mortar.  The vaults appear to be of one build, although only a small area (down to the level of ground reduction) was available for examination.   Wall masonry: The level of ground reduction is too high to see whether the 17th Century architects (Wren or Hooke) have reused any pre-existing Medieval foundations (ie whether the church was aligned N-S in the Medieval period).    On the west side of the church, brickwork behind panelling has been exposed to a height of 1.17m.  The elevation is of roughly coursed soft red brick, laid on end (the main axis of the brick projecting backwards into the wall), with a white friable mortar with frequent pebble and chalk inclusions.  The dimensions as visible are 100mm x 60mm.  It was not possible to see whether the bricks were frogged.  Patches of repair are visible in the form of later bricks and a hard grey mortar.  This elevation may represent the core of the wall of the original post-1666 rebuild of the church, which would have been faced with brick and plaster and has later been panelled.  On the east side, wall masonry is exposed in two places where panelling has been removed. Immediately opposite the area described above, the panelling again has been removed to a height of 1.17m.  The wall as visible shows a series of rebuilds, all of brick, no reused Medieval stone is visible.  A sketch elevation was drawn.  The core of the original wall (coursed soft red brick with a friable white mortar) was observed and tiles (reused Medieval?) were visible associated with this brickwork but partly hidden under a later hard grey cement.

At the rear of the existing main building, over archaeologically sterile Cretaceous chalk, was either Pleistocene head chalk or in situ Cretaceous chalk degraded by Pleistocene freeze-thaw processes, overlain by Pleistocene head of mostly clayey, often flinty chalk gravels tending to give way to chalky, mostly clayey flint gravels. Most or all of these were probably laid in a relatively high-energy but non-fluvial environment. They were truncated and overlain directly by modern construction horizons. These natural deposits were found between 58.9m OD and 64.13m OD, generally sloping down from west to east.  A few foundation-inspection pits had been dug and backfilled beforehand and their fills appeared similar to those seen during the watching brief, with no post-Pleistocene, pre-Modern material present. No artefacts or ecofacts were identified in the pre-Modern material and the representative samples recovered have been assessed as of very low to low potential. A single small pit was cored through the suspended floor slab close to the street frontage: it too encountered head material overlain by what was probably a modern construction horizon.  It is concluded that the whole of the rear area has been terraced into the hillside inthe modern period and that there has also been modern ground-reduction at the front. These activities will have removed any post-Pleistocene archaeological remains there may once have been (save, potentially, deep features such as wells). The local Pleistocene environment was probably an unstable, fairly high energy one, with a low potential for archaeological or palaeoenvironmental evidence (though any present might, potentially, be highly significant). It is recommended that no further archaeological work is undertaken at the rear of the site nor, unless major groundworks are intended, at the front.",

Three evaluation trenches were excavated. Excavation of Trench 2 ceased in mid October after asbestos was found. Asbestos removal took place 16-25 November 2016. A fourth and final trench was due to be excavated in 2017 after the demolition of an outbuilding associated with the Marine Society. Across the three trenches, natural gravels were observed between 1.04m and 1.28m OD, and brickearth between 1.71m and 2.07m OD.   There were two distinct phases of archaeology identified in this evaluation: Medieval and Post Medieval. The Medieval period was characterised by two pits and a small linear ditch. These features were located in the south-eastern part of the site (Trench 1) and may be associated with settlement; quarrying and/or agricultural drainage. Pottery dated both to the latter part of the late Medieval period, between 1240-1350 and 1240-1400 respectively. In the north-eastern corner of the southern half of the site a north-east to south-west aligned ditch was uncovered. This ditch is likely to represent the Medieval estate boundary ditch for the grounds of Lambeth Palace- as depicted on both a map of the Palace c 1600 and on Roque's map of 1746, which had remained absent in the archaeological record until this evaluation.  The Post Medieval archaeology was predominantly characterised by brick wall foundations; property walls; brick wells; brick soak-aways/cesspits; and ground raising layers all associated with the 18th Century construction and development of terraced houses. Within the 19th Century the terraces were demolished in advance of the construction of the railway viaduct and following the second world war as a result of bomb damage. The report concludes that Medieval and Post Medieval archaeological remains will be impacted by the redevelopment of this site. Whislt the refurbishment of the arches should not impact on the surviving archaeology, the new basement will remove all archaeology within its footprint. The Post Medieval archaeological remains all relate to the construction of the terraced houses and their occupation.   From this evaluation we now have an archaeological record of these deposits and features thus it is deemed that excavation is not likely to add greatly to the corpus of information available regarding late Post Medieval activity in Lambeth. There are also standing examples of the terraced houses located immediately to the south-west of the site, fronting onto Lambeth Road. There would however be a major impact on the late Medieval dated pits and ditch, and the Medieval estate boundary ditch in that they would be removed in their entirety.  In the light of the results of the evaluation, Museum of London Archaeology considered that the in-situ late Medieval dated cut features should be excavated archaeologically in advance of any further ground reduction. This site offers an opportunity to investigate the Medieval estate boundary for the Archbishop's Palace, a feature of medium to high significance, with evidential and historical value which has not been previously archaeologically recorded. However, whilst the archaeological remains are of local significance there is nothing to suggest that they are of regional or national importance, and the decision on appropriate archaeological mitigations rests with the Local Planning Authority.",

Foundations of the 19th Century Main Pavilion and the 1924 India Pavilion from the 1924 British Empire Exhibition may survive.   Should any such remains be found on the site, they would potentially be of low to medium heritage significance. The site has generally low potential for all other periods as it lies on the extensive London Clay, which would probably have been heavily wooded until the end later Medieval period.   Historic maps indicate that it lay within open fields some distance from the historic settlement centres, until the mid-19th Century when the site was first developed. Archaeological survival potential is predicted to be moderate in the footprint of the current buildings and moderate to high outside the buildings' footprint. The main potential is for Post Medieval remains associated with the India Pavilion from the British Empire Exhibition of 1924.   There is a lower potential for footings of the southern edge of the earlier late-19th Century main pavilion/golf club house in the central northern part of the site.",

The amendment was approved subject to a photographic survey being undertaken to record the affected sections of the dry dock structure before and after the trimming works were undertaken.  The survey took place prior to the installation of three ground beams over the Dry Dock. The enabling works required a partial removal of the structure at 6 locations; this varied from a small trim of the top of the surviving brickwork and concrete to removal of a few courses of bricks, stone and concrete; additionally, timber uprights at the north-western end of the Dock (western side) were sawn off to a required level. In two locations worked granite blocks were lifted (a coping stone at the south-eastern end and curved stones at the north-western end of the structure); they were subsequently deposited within the Dry Dock prior to its final backfilling.  During the photographic survey, which was carried out in addition to the previous archaeological watching brief (ELO 17972), the Dry Dock was recorded prior to the enabling works, during the works and on the completion.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

In 1232-46 Gildhalla can be placed in the parish of St Lawrence Jewry, and deeds of the later 13th Century fix it on or about the present site. The earliest comprehensive remains date to the late 13th Century, but at two places works preceding this phase have been noted. In the north wall of the west crypt a pilaster of the crypt blocked a recess with a carefully prepared white plaster surface, suggesting that the crypt was a modification of an earlier stone building, at least along its north side. The lower of two different wall fragments below the 15th Century porch to the south-east, of ragstone on a mortared ragstone foundation, is also probably of a building two phases before the 15th Century. This wall had a dressed rag face on the west, 1.2m below the floor level of the 15th Century porch. Together these two fragments suggest a stone building preceded the late 13th Century rebuilding, but there is no further indication of date. Excavations of 1987-8 and 1992-7 beneath and east of Guildhall Yard uncovered a Roman amphitheatre and 11th Century timber buildings above it. The surviving west undercroft, now much restored, is of three aisles five bays long, the easternmost bays truncated by the west wall of the later east undercroft. The windows of the west undercroft in their present form probably date from alterations in the late 15th Century, and the vaulting alone can be dated, though only roughly, to 1200-1340. Documentary evidence would suggest dates of either the 1280s, since work on the adjacent chapel began in the 1290s, or 1333-5, when repairs are recorded; the closest architectural analogy, an undercroft of c 1290 at Penshurst Place, Kent, suggests the former date. Archaeological observation in 1968 recorded a length of walling, of ragstone and bands of knapped flint, beneath the west wall of the 15th Century porch which may be part of this wing; the use of knapped flint in this way would suggest a date in the 14th Century. Guildhall was rebuilt in 1411-30 by John Croxton, mason, whose previous work is not known. Work on the roof was in progress in 1418, and in 1423 Richard Whittington left money to pave the hall with Purbeck marble; construction may have been finished by 1430. Croxton inserted buttresses in the west undercroft (necessary support for the new unaisled hall if the previous hall had been aisled), cut off the easternmost bay of the undercroft and built a new east undercroft of three aisles, four bays long.",

The site lies in the Peckham Archaeological Priority Zone.  The on-site recording took place on the 23rd September and 21st-22nd October. The records will be deposited with the Museum of London.  Four test pits were opened measuring 1.5m square, along with a further three test pits measuring 0.5m square. Existing street level was approximately 6.40 to 6.50m OD. Test pits 1 and 2 were on the western edge of the site. Test pit 1 was 3.5m depth, and revealed 1.80m of mixed Post Medieval overburden, overlying natural clay. Test pit 2 was only dug to a depth of 1.3m, and only encountered the mixed overburden with bricks throughout. Test pit 3 was opened to the east of the site, near the High Street frontage. This encountered a brick-lined well of late 18th/early 19th Century date, measuring 0.8m in diameter. Natural was at 1.50m below ground level. This required the opening of another pit, 3A, as the well made it impossible to assess the adjacent wall foundations. In this trench, 1m of modern disturbance overlay 0.35m clayey silt with occasional bone and gravel, which in turn sealed 0.10m thick compacted gravel surface. This overlay 0.15m of clayey-silt, which then overlay the natural. Test pit 4 was on the eastern side of the site, 1.70m from the site boundary. The upper 0.95m was mixed brick, gravel and mortar which overlay 0.20m of sandy silt with charcoal and gravel. This sealed 0.15m of sandy silt which overlay natural. What appeared to be a posthole in a post-pit was partially revealed in the south west corner of test pit 4, with a maximum diameter of 0.70m with the posthole being 0.23m by 0.16m, rectangular in shape and 0.20m deep. It was certainly cutting the natural but the relationship with the other stratigraphy was unclear. Whilst cleaning the area after machining, a single sherd of late Medieval pottery was recovered. The three smaller test pits, 5, 6 and 7, were only excavated to 0.5m deep, and consisted of Modern make-up levels.  The gravel surface, possibly a path, found in test pit 3A, measuring at least 1.8m in length but the full extent of which was unknown, was provisionally dated as Medieval. The post-hole and post-pit found in test pit 4 may be associated with this surface and form part of a structure of fence line. These archaeological remains, though fragmentary, are potentially of great importance as there is very little evidence of the Early Medieval/Medieval settlement of Peckham.Given that the foundations would have an impact on the archaeology, it was recommended that the threatened areas should be archaeologically excavated and recorded in advance of construction.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The land was divided into two areas with separate planning permissions, but both were excavated simultaneously and are reported together. Previous excavations at the neighbouring site of 49-51 Tanner Street had identified a high potential for Prehistoric and Post Medieval archaeology.  Trench 1, on the western site, measured 16.4m by 3.8m, while Trench 2, on the eastern site, measured 22m by 3.8m. Present ground level is approximately 2.80m aOD. The site is located on the southern edge of Horsleydown Eyot, a sand and gravel islet on the southern Thames floodplain, which was exploited throughout Prehistory and into the Roman period, albeit at times marginally and seasonally. The area was then regularly flooded or possibly entirely inundated, covering the area in a deep deposit of alluvium, before occupation was renewed in the Post Medieval period, when the area was used for the tanning industry. Natural sandy gravels were encountered in both trenches, sloping from north to south, from -0.54m OD to -0.74m OD in Trench 1, and -0.56m OD to -0.67m OD in Trench 2. These were overlain by fine-grained silty sands, also sloping from north to south. The top of this deposit was recorded 0.5m aOD sloping to 0.36m aOD in Trench 1, and 0.44m aOD sloping to 0.24m aOD in Trench 2.   The earliest significant archaeological features were a pit, ditch and tree throw, and a layer filled with cultural material, dated to the Mid to Late Neolithic, observed in the north of Trench 2. The pit measured 1.36m by 1.34m and was 0.44m deep, containing charcoal flecks and two pieces of struck flint. The ditch was oriented north west - south east, and was located immediately north of the pit. It measured 2.6m in length but extended beyond the limits of the excavation, was 1.25m wide and a maximum of 0.44m. It contained a sherd of Neolithic pottery and a small assemblage of struck flints. Disturbing the north-western end of the ditch was the tree throw, measuring 3.4m by 3.46m and 0.31m deep, and filled with frequent charcoal, fragments of at least seven Neolithic vessels and 29 worked flints, as well as 105 grams of burnt flint. This fill also produced three fragments of daub and a fragment of cattle tooth. All of this suggests that the tree throw had been used as a domestic shelter, or possibly for ritual deposition. These features were overlain by a 0.18m thick deposit of grey silty sand containing further Neolithic cultural material, including a medium sized pottery assemblage, 78 flints and 1020 grams of burnt flint, as well as sixteen small to medium sized fragments of abraded daub, suggesting building activity nearby. This layer was only recorded in the north of Trench 2, with the southern part possibly having been scoured away by Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age riverine action.  The next phase of activity was recorded in Trench 1, comprising an approximately north-south alignment of stakes with clear axe marks. The stakes were of two different types - one of radially cleft oak (unusual for Prehistoric London sites) and the other using roundwood stakes of hazel, alder and cherry. The former would have made for a more solid fence or revetment, while the latter suggest a less durable wattle-work fence, possibly indicating two separate structures or phases of structure. Further stakeholes immediately to the east of the stakes suggest the fence was regularly moved, perhaps on a seasonal basis. These stakes were dated to the Early/Middle Bronze Age, having been sealed by an overlying Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age soil horizon. This homogenous layer was found in both trenches, and contained Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age cultural material and Late Bronze Age lithics. A high preponderance of scraper tools among the struck flints suggests animal processing was taking place, while a chopped goat horn core suggests accompanying craft activities such as horn working. Burned and fired daub were also recovered from this layer, indicative of building activity or a nearby hearth, along with fragments of horse and cattle bones. In the north of Trench 1, this deposit sealed sixteen fragmented ard marks. A large ditch, observed in both trenches, cut through this deposit on an east-west alignment, measuring 1.7m wide and 0.65m deep. This feature was also recorded at the neighbouring 49-51 Tanner Street site. The base of the ditch sloped downwards from east to west, and was recorded even lower at the neighbouring site, suggesting it drained to the west. In Trench 2, a bank formed of the upcast was piled to the south of the ditch. The bank and ditch have been interpreted as a form of river defence, implying that the river was flooding more frequently as sea levels rose.   To the north of the ditch in Trench 2, a double row of stakes, aligned east-west, was discovered. Charcoal discovered between these parallel fence lines suggests that they may have supported wattle. The wide, flat axe marks and their stratigraphic relationship to the Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age soil through which they were driven suggests an Iron Age date. This feature was not recorded in Trench 1, suggesting an isolated area having been fenced off, possibly for use as an animal pen, though this was not suggested by the phosphate analysis. A layer of sandy silt, representing colluvium washed down from further up the island, was recorded to the north of the ditch in both trenches, overlaying the backfilled ditch but abutting the fence, showing that the fence was still standing after the ditch had gone out of use. Analysis of the pollen, plant macrofossil and insect assemblages from the dark grey-brown organic peaty silt/clay layer in the lower-lying south of the site suggests that this area had become marshy by the Middle Iron Age, and a sample was radiocarbon dated to between 410 BC and 360 BC.  After this, the site became entirely inundated, with Roman tile and a ceramic vessel having been recovered from the 0.8m thick deposit of estuarine silts and clays. With the exception of a small pit in Trench 2 which contained a sherd of Roman pottery, occupation did not resume on site until the 17th Century. This is represented by a cess pit in Trench 2, measuring 2.42m north to south and 1.56m east to west, extending beyond the western edge of the trench. Pottery and clay pipes date the last use of this pit to the late 17th Century. Horn cores with holes punched through them were also found, possibly associated with the hanging of animal skins still attached to the skulls as part of the process of leather preparation. This cesspit was contemporary with the tanning pit found at the neighbouring 49-51 Tanner Street site, and may have been attached to the same workshop. Finally, a well or soak-away was recorded in Trench 1, partially backfilled with concrete. This may be associated with the 19th-early 20th Century tanning factory found at 49-51 Tanner Street.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The focus of the recording was the chancel walls, which were exposed through works to replace and renew the render wall finish. Attempts were also made to record the chancel roof, but lack of safe access meant that only limited observations could be made.  The report concludes that, contrary to the list description, the chancel walls may retain aspects of the 1266 Norman phase of the church, including the angled buttresses on the eastern gable and a relocated blind lancet window in the northern chancel wall, though without further analysis it is difficult to be certain. This early phase appears to have been constructed from chalk and sandstone, with a roof 1m lower than present.  The 1505 rebuild of the church is clearly represented in the red brickwork of the upper walls and the full height buttresses on the northern and southern elevations. The roof is probably also of this period, though without further analysis this is impossible to prove. 18th Century alterations to the chancel included the provision of larger windows and the renewal and repair of the external face of the lower chancel walls.",

An initial evaluation comprising two trenches, carried out from November 1st 1994 to December 12th 1994, demonstrated that the site was on a sand island, or eyot. Prehistoric artefacts were recorded on the top of the eyot in Trench 1 (18.8m by 7m) and from near a palaeo-stream channel in Trench 2 (7m by 5m). These were sealed by a layer of alluvium, from which Roman and Medieval finds were recovered, followed by Post-Medieval land reclamation dumps. In Trench 1, the substantial remains of an 18th Century glassworks were discovered, including the kiln and ancilliary structures. A second, more substantial 19th Century glassworks, known to have been owned by prominent glassworker Apsley Pellatt, was also investigated.  In response to the evident archaeological potential of the site, it was decided that more extensive excavation and investigation would have to precede further development. Area 1 (18th August-1st September 1995) measured 13.2m by 3.2m. Area 2 (20th February-12th May 1996) involved re-exposing evaluation Trench 1, and measured 20m by 14m. Area 3 (17th May-28th June 1996) involved 12 smaller pad foundation trenches of around 2m square. Concrete slabs and modern overburden were removed by a mechanical excavator under archaeological supervision, and all subsequent exposed surfaces were investigated and cleaned using appropriate hand tools. Natural gravels were revealed between 0.24m and 0.10m aOD, overlain by natural sands up to 1.2m thick, forming the eyot.  These sands were overlain by an occupation deposit of brownish grey silty sand with charcoal fleck inclusions, averaging between 100mm and 130mm thick but with some higher ridges of 170mm to 200mm, representing a Prehistoric subsoil. Associated with this layer were a wide variety of Prehistoric features indicative of an area of extensive occupation and differing zones of activity, including agriculture and domestic occupation. These features included a concentration of approximately 390 stakeholes, generally circular or oval and 70mm in diameter, were associated with this occupation layer, indicating an area of land management measuring at least 24m by 12m across Areas 2 and 3. Their precise function has not yet been determined. A series of approximately 40 substantial structural postholes, mostly circular or sub-circular and between 0.35m and 0.5m across, were found in Area 5. Some smaller and less regular holes may represent small pits. Ard marks were also discovered, along with a pit and ditch to the west, whose fill contained pot sherds, charcoal and worked flints.   Episodic flooding and alluvial deposition led to the abandonment of the site from the Late Neolithic, and continued throughout the Roman and Medieval periods. In Area 1, a deposit of very sticky dark grey-black clay-silt containing sand lenses, mollusc shells and moderate quantities of ceramic building material, glazed pottery, clay pipes and charcoal flecks was interpreted as the remains of a historically documented tidal mill pond, known to have been on site by the mid 16th Century, if not earlier. The southern edge of the pond was marked by timber revetments, and was associated with a number of ditches and timber structures which are more likely to be water management features than trackways. This mill pond was later modified, with the timber revetment replaced by a more substantial brick retaining wall.  After a series of Post Medieval dumps of material for land reclamation purposes dated to the 17th and 18th Centuries, the remains of an early glasshouse kiln of mid 18th Century date were observed cutting these dump layers in Area 2. This early glasshouse comprised a central furnace area, 0.7m wide and 3m long, between two opposing platforms and flues in the form of underground passages, 1.7m wide, running to the north and south. The kiln appears to have been rebuilt a number of times. A number of contemporary structures were observed in Area 4, which may possibly have included residential properties, a schoolhouse (perhaps the historically documented Christ Church Parochial School) and a pin manufactory. The glasshouse was then replaced by the more substantial 19th Century glassworks of Apsley Pellatt. Both this and the school house were destroyed by the publication of the 1894-6 OS maps.",A GIS point was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The suspected ring ditch overlain by Trench 7 was less convincing. A ring ditch was not readily discernible though Ditch Terminus F1041 and Ditch F1066 did contain late Bronze Age pottery. Finally, the suspected ring ditch overlain by Trench 6 was not identifiable. Ditches were present but were broadly parallel (Ditches F1029, F1031, F1033 and F1038), and either undated or modern. Large ditch F1045 was Medieval and contained residual Late Bronze Age pottery).  Late Bronze Age pottery was derived from ditches located within Trenches 6 (F1045) and 7 (F1041 and F1066). The Late Bronze Age pottery assemblages were quite large (15, 14, 11 and 7 sherds). A burnt flint and sparse fragments of daub were found in association with the Late Bronze Age pottery (F1045). Seven Early to Middle Saxon sherds were present as residual sherds within medieval Ditches F1043 and F1045.  Medieval features were also recorded in Trenches 6 (F1043 and F1045) and 7 (F1085), and the features were all ditches. Ditch F1045 contained both Late Bronze Age and also Medieval pottery. It cut Ditch F1043 and therefore the Prehistoric pottery is residual. Sparse fragments of daub were found in association with the Medieval pottery. The Medieval features may be associated with the moat, yards and pleasure gardens associated with 'Aldborough Hall', which lay outside of the area of investigation to the west.  *Natural geology was observed between 0.36m and 0.63m below the modern surface level, which was between 26.43m OD and 27.29m OD.*",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

The timber floor within Room GF170 lay at c. 9.34 m OD.   The evaluation showed that the Tudor frontage of the palace had survived under the present day floors and walls of Room GF 170, including the bay windows on the eastern frontage. The extent and depth of the Tudor moat in this area was not established during the evaluation due to the limitations of the excavations. The Tudor frontage was represented by a north-south aligned wall recorded at a maximum height of 8.8m OD. The wall was constructed of red hand made unfrogged bricks that measured 220-260 x 100 x 60mm. The wall was built in an English bond of alternate headers and stretchers (although this became more irregular with depth) bonded by a white lime mortar that was double struck. The wall was at least 0.69m high and was observed over 5.6m although it had been truncated at its northern end. An east-west return was located at the northern end of the north-south wall, that was also built of hand made unfrogged bricks that mainly measured 220- x 100 x 60mm, with occasional larger bricks up to 240 x 111-112 x 62mm. The return was 1.4m wide and was at least 0.60m long EW.   Built up to north-south wall was the northern part of a bay window comprising two sections of dog legged brickwork, an inner wall and an outer wall. The construction cut for these windows truncated an upper mixed dump layer containing mortar, ceramic building material (CBM) flecks, clay tobacco pipe and pottery of 17th or early 18th Century date as well as 17th Century Flemish floor tiles, which in turn sealed two further dump layers. The bay window walls must therefore post-date these deposits. The rebuilding of the Tudor palace by Wren in the period 1690-1692 resulted in the palace encroaching over the backfilled moat, with the construction of the new Queen's apartments including Room GF170. The evidence for floor joists dating to the Wren period of construction comes from floor pads that were located at c 9.10m OD. Also dating to this period was a fireplace base located at 8.9m OD. A contemporary drainage system ran across the room on a NW/SE alignment.  The construction of three sleeper walls that were built over the Wren floor pads dates to the late 18th Century/19th Century. The drainage system was possibly replaced again in the mid 19th Century that resulted in the rebuilding of the sleeper walls. The current timber floor surface had re-used the timber joists from the Wren period of construction.  Natural geology had previously been encountered at c9m OD at Base Court, 150m of the site. Exploratory sondages on the current site were dug down to c 8.m OD where they encountered dumped deposits that were at least 1m thick that either represented the backfilling of the moat itself or levelling over the top of it prior to a rebuilding phase.",A GIS polygon was created over the approximate location of the site using OS Master Map as a map base at 1:1250.

Above them, remains of the 17th Century expansion of London into this area, north of Long Acre, may also survive: pits, ditches and features from the gardens of houses known to be here by about 1650. This assessment recommends evaluation of the strata which will be affected by the proposed development. This might be done by observing any pits dug for geotechnical reasons, for instance on the sites of the future lift shaft pits.

The recording of a 30m section across the defences revealed a sequence of activity from before ad120 to the 17th Century. The earliest dated feature was a shallow flat-bottomed ditch (probably a pre-wall boundary), the fill of which contained pottery of c AD120 and the remains of two human skeletons. The foundation trench for the city wall was cut through a deposit which yielded pottery of c 180, as did the internal bank and deposits dumped against the external face of the wall. The wall survived to its full width of 2.7m and to a height of 1.7m above the plinth. A longitudinal section through the wall facilitated the recording of details of its construction: a singular feature was an offset on its external face. A V-shaped ditch, 3.5m from the wall, was possibly contemporary with its construction. A localised change in the construction of the wall proved to be the blocking of a doorway and passage, and it is likely that this Medieval postern was a private thoroughfare for the incumbents of Holy Trinity Priory. Other features of the priory recorded include a doorway and undercroft in the dorter. An arched brick wall constructed parallel to and up against the internal face of the city wall is probably part of a Medieval renovation.

The site appears to have been on the fringe of settlement activity up until the Post Medieval period. Cartographic sources show that the site was developed from at least 1681, having been likely previously only been used as agricultural fields. The site and study area was redeveloped from 1707 when Queen Square and St. George the Martyr Church were constructed. At this time, Old Gloucester Street was formally planned and the site was redeveloped into residential buildings with rear yards. In 1877 the site was redeveloped again into St. George the Martyr Parochial School for Boys, which ceased to exist in the 1970's.  The site has a high potential for Post Medieval archaeological remains, moderate potential for Roman archaeological remains, a low potential for other periods.

Toward the end of the Century, the layout of the dock complex was radically altered, with a new channel linking the Main Dock (renamed Albert Dock) with the Canada Dock. The now redundant Albion Pond was abandoned and infilled, though the entrance channel was retained and converted into a dry dock. Other elements excavated included the footings for a lifting bridge that spanned the channel connecting the docks, and some mooring posts related to it.

The property was listed primarily for its historical associations relating to the English Civil War, Charles I and the Parliamentarians.  The property is the most notable house in Uxbridge and originates from the early 16th Century when it was known as Place House. The archival evidence shows that by 1789 the building was in its present form, having been reduced in size to a single wing of the original 16th Century house as a result of the Oxford Road was widened to accommodate increasing coaching traffic and the property was converted into a coaching inn.  In 1645 the house was used for meetings between Royalist and Parliamentary representatives negotiating the abortive 'treaty' of that year; it was then a larger property and one of considerable significance. Documentary sources describe the property as having two curvilinear (Dutch) gables above the bays on its principal front and a two-storey bay window at its north-east end. The sources indicate that by the end of the 18th Century the High Street had been diverted to run immediately past the house, which at that time was let out in tenements.  The inspection of the property showed the ground floor had been comprehensively altered to the extent that any trace of an original room plan has been lost by the creation of a large open plan bar with modern kitchen at the southern end. The WC's are modern additions and the rear staircase is housed within a 20th Century structure with flat roof. The fireplace and surround appear to be reproductions.

Modern pavement level near to the site lies at c 4.30m OD.  Two trenches were opened, Trench 1 in the northern area of the site, measuring 11m by 4m, with a maximum depth of 1.9m, and Trench 2 to the south-west, which measured 12m by 4m, and was excavated to a depth of 1.2-1.4m, although a test pit was dug within the trench to a depth of 3.6m below ground level.   Natural gravels were observed at 2.50m OD in Trench 1. At the western end of Trench 1 a brick-lined cess pit was observed, built of re-used bricks predating the Great Fire (1666). A brick divide and the infill dated the cess pit to between 1830-1850. Associated garden soil was also found. The cess pit went out of use some time just after the Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848, and was built over by later 19th Century terraced housing.   Natural sands and gravels were seen at 1m OD in a machine-dug test pit within Trench 2. These were sealed by 1.25m of sandy clay, interpreted as marginal floodplain alluvium. Cutting this alluvium was an east-west drainage gulley, the fill of which contained clay tobacco pipe bowl fragments, pottery and glass of 18th Century date. The gulley and alluvium were sealed by layers of late 19th Century made and disturbed ground relating to the terraced buildings evident in Trench 1.

The work was at the request of Mr J.G. Hurst (Assistant Inspector of Ancient Monuments), funded by the Department of the Environment, and the grant administered by the Research and Fieldwork Committee of the Essex Archaeological Society.   The watching brief in 1971 involved the monitoring of the removal of a hedge and associated ditch and the levelling of another ditch. Following this the cutting of new service trenches was monitored.   In 1972 a 180m trench (Trench A) was cut along the southern edge of the excavation area. Trenches 1 to 19 (each 50m long) were cut at right angles to Trench A at 20m intervals. Trench B was cut across the north side of the area. All trenches were excavated by machine.   In the centre of the excavation area, the north-western corners of what is interpreted as Pyrgo Palace were recorded as features 13, 15 and 35. It is thought these walls were not all constructed at the same time. North of the remains of the house were the gardens. These gardens were bounded by walls recorded as f75 to the north-east and f8 to the south-east. A dry ditch is also thought to have run along the west of the gardens. A possible plant house was found in f81 (with a tiled floor). A level area recorded at f137 is interpreted as the location of a bowling green, documented in the early 18th Century. A series of drains were also recorded across the gardens.   A hollow (f135), recorded adjacent to the northern extent of the walls of Pyrgo Palace revealed during the evaluation, was found to contain dark soil with many late 13th Century pottery sherds. These were almost entirely Mill Green ware of later thirteenth to mid fourteenth Century date. A further 1.5kg of pottery were recovered from other contexts, including more Mill Green ware and Post Medieval types such as 16th and 18th Century stoneware and 17th Century local earthenwares.   The presence of Mill Green ware suggests that a house of yeoman or gentry status stood nearby in the later 13th Century. 15th Century brick and tiles may have come from this house too.

These may be derived from features beneath the topsoil, although little archaeological significance can be derived from such a small quantity of finds.  The concentrations of burnt flint may be related to cooking or cleaning,  supported by their general distribution which; as in this case, is often related to a nearby river or stream. The pieces of hot flint would have been used to heat up the water in vessels or pits  though it is also equally plausible that some of the material was specifically reserved for tempering in pots.  The Post Medieval pottery and tile are probably derived from nearby. Such materials were often thrown onto farmyard midden heaps which were then spread across the fields during manuring.

A previous desk-based assessment (Wessex Archaeology 1990a) found that there were no features or find spots within the Site. However a study of aerial photographs show numerous Prehistoric/Romano-British features in the vicinity.   The fieldwork comprised 24 machine-excavated trenches (Trenches 1-24) totalling 1440m^2, representing c.3.5% sample of the area.  The trenches measured 20mx3m and all were excavated by a tracked 360 degree excavator and a 1.8m wide toothless bucket. The machine removed deposits to the top of in situ archaeological or geological deposits.   Rob Whytehead (English Heritage) monitored the excavation on the 4th March 1999.   Topsoil was an average thickness of c.0.3m with a maximum thickness of 0.4m and a minimum of 0.2m. Subsoil had a boundary with geological deposits which was undulating, sometimes penetrating 0.2-0.3m. Brickearth had a thickness of only c.0.2m on trenches 7 and 13 and overlay Kempton Park Gravel.   The evaluation demonstrated a low level of archaeological activity of probable late Prehistoric (Middle - ?Late Bronze Age) date within the southern part of the area evaluated. Only one feature, a Middle Bronze Age pit (1208), produced dating material and no stratigraphic relationships could be determined.

The results of the evaluation suggest that the depth of archaeological deposits where they survive on the site is likely to be between 1.55m (horizontal stratigraphy), extending to 2.9m or more in the localised areas of deeper cut features. Horizontal stratigraphy is likely to represent Post Medieval external activity in the yards and gardens of 18th-/19th Century properties fronting on to Kings Mews and the open space that preceded it. Cut features may include Post Medieval pits, brick structures such as soakaways, wells, cess pits and cellars and features representing earlier quarrying of uncertain date. Modern disturbance appears to be relatively limited and in the form of localised demolition activity prior to construction of the existing 1950s building and construction of the foundations themselves.  The report concludes that Post Medieval and to a lesser extent potentially earlier undated archaeological remains may be impacted by the redevelopment. The newly proposed 4m deep basement would entail the removal of any surviving deposits and features within its footprint. The surviving remains are however considered to be of limited local significance. Modern ground level was at 21.44m aOD, and natural sands and gravels were encountered at a maximum height of 18.81m aOD.",

In October 2017 Oxford Archaeology was asked to update the report using an updated development plan and the current report represents this update.  Archaeological and historical evidence has demonstrated that the Survey area has the potential to contain surviving archaeological deposits, mainly later Post Medieval. There may be the remains of 19th Century buildings present on the Survey area and pockets of older archaeological deposits in areas which were previously used as 19th Century yards and gardens. Within the wider Survey area the potential for remains to be preserved is dependent on the extent of truncation and disturbance that has previously occurred.  This Archaeological Desk Based Assessment has demonstrated that the Survey area contains low potential for Prehistoric remains, high potential for Roman remains, low potential for Saxon remains, low potential for Medieval remains and high potential for Post Medieval remains.   In the event of their demolition the two surviving 19th Century buildings within the Survey area may require a programme of building recording.",

Cartographic analysis demonstrates that the eastern part of site, in the early 1800's, was within the rear property of the Nags Head Coaching Inn and encompassed a garden and a pond. The rest of site consisted of part of a field with another pond. The ponds were infilled by the 1930s, and the site remained as either fields or an open space prior to 1959-1960 when it became a car park.  The data supplied by the Greater London Historic Environment Record (GLHER) indicates a high potential for Roman remains on site. This is due to site being part of two areas of high archaeological potential (AHAP). The first area is recorded by Stable Heritage (2014) as 'AHAP10: Roman Welling', which is believed to be a Roman settlement. The archaeological evidence from find spots and events have proven that there is Roman occupation and funerary remains surrounding site and within 500m of the site. The second area is recorded as 'AHAP9: Watling Street', which is a Roman road from Dover to Shooters Hill. The Roman settlement in Welling is believed to have straddled this road. Both AHAP areas are significant at a local and regional level and Watling Street is also considered nationally significant. Any new archaeological findings would strengthen the significance of the evidence base for both the road and the known settlement. There is a low potential for other time periods i.e. Pre-Historic, Early Medieval, Medieval and Modern to be represented on site.  There is only one designated asset, Danson Park (RPG1) within the study area and is located 345m south east of the site.

In the north-eastern part of the site the natural gravel appeared to be approximately 2 metres higher than in any other part of the site, suggestive of a possible eyot. Five archaeological trial trenches were opened - Trench 1, measuring 17.20m N-S by 9.00m E-W, in the northern corner of the site on the significantly higher gravels, and Trenches 2-5 measuring 22.40m in length by 4.20m evenly covering the rest of the site.

The wall cut in Trench 5 and the natural deposits in Trenches 2 and 3 were all sealed by an accumulation of modern deposits that was up to 2.75m in thickness.  The evidence indicates that during the Medieval and Post Medieval periods the site was occupied as marsh pasture until the development of the Surrey Commercial Docks in the latter half of the 19th Century.

The examination of the contemporary crucibles included the analysis of copper alloy droplets trapped in their vitrified surfaces. The chemical composition of these droplets differed significantly from the buckles and other contemporary copper alloy artefacts. The examination of the 16th-17th Century crucibles showed that they were manufactured from a different clay source to that used in the 13th and 14th Centuries.

The watching brief monitored six geotechnical boreholes and three test pits.   Nearly all of the deposits seen in the boreholes appeared disturbed, redeposited or heavily truncated. Certainly there is little palaeoenvironmental or geoarchaeololgical potential for the site and the impact on any archaeological remains along the river frontage of the building in particular is considered minimal. However, previous archaeological work and to some degree this geoarchaeological watching brief, has found significant archaeology in the central area of the building which would be greatly affected by enlarging the basement area. Results from three excavated test pits demonstrated a considerable thickness of concrete slab, up to 1.85m depth from ground-level down, in the north-west corner of site and the external area immediately north of the car-park. The depth of the slab in these areas may be localised, but is likely indicative of a substantial concrete raft at ground-level across the site. Modern made ground was observed beneath the slab at all three locations. No archaeological deposits were observed at these depths.  *The natural was not observed.*",

This represents the second and third phases of building recording. The first took place between August and December 2005.  In all, over the three phases, 18 buildings were survey and described before their demolition or extensive remodelling.  The Royal London Hospital was founded on Whitechapel Road in 1752 according to a design by Boulton Mainwaring. The East and Wings were added to the pre-existing Front Block in 1775 and 1778 respectively by the architect Edward Hawkins and enclosed a garden to the rear of the Front Block. The Wings were 6 bays long and two storeys high. They were later extended during the 1830s to a design by A.R.Mason and sanitary towers were added by Charles Barry Jun. during the 1860s and 1870s. Further remodelling of the south ends of each wing was undertaken by Rowland Plumbe between 1896-1906 and two extra floors were added. The continuous alterations throughout the 18th and 19th Centuries maintained a homogenous architectural concept of two identical muted classical style buildings of 6:3:7 bays long, on five floors with a basement, constructed in brick with flat gauged arched windows with double-hung sashes. The purpose of the wings was for patient wards, a function which was retained throughout their use-age, although the East Wing also contained specialist clinics. Internally the wings were originally divided by a central spine wall. During the 1960s both wards were modernised, the interior was gutted and a central corridor was laid out removing the central spine wall and dividing ancillary rooms and private rooms from larger wards.  From the late 1870s the hospital was extended to the south and many new buildings were added across a 40 acre site bounded by Whitechapel Road to the north, Cavell Street to the east, Newark Street to the south and New Road. Freestanding clinical structures such as Fielden House (1901) were built throughout the history of the hospital; however the pattern has more usually been one of adaption or rebuilding such as the Alexandra Wing (1978-82) which replaced an earlier building of the same name originally constructed in 1864-6. Fielden House was originally an isolation block and latterly a paediatrics unit and was brick-built on five floors plus basement and had purpose-built sanitary towers which exemplified the reforms in attempts to prevent epidemic at the time. The Alexandra Wing had projecting stock brick piers with a canted face dividing the windows and until 2011 served the hospital as an accident and emergency department complete with roof-top helicopter pad. The staff were also provided with a swimming pool in 1926. Ancillary buildings such as the Old Laundry (1904) and Estates Department (1909) were built to the south of Stepney Way.  There were also non-medical, private enterprises on land rented from the hospital such as a public house - the Oxford Arms (c.1869), and a clothing factory - the Garment Factory (c.1875-90).  The 20th Century saw a proliferation of new clinical structures constructed in such as the Link Block (1965), Holland Wing (1969), Garden House (1990-1) and the David Hughes Building (c.2002).",
